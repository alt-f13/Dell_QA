# Dell_QA
DCU project, developing a DellQA dataset


This research proposes creating a high-quality custom QA dataset called DellQA for IT support. Data will be scraped from Dell's IT community support forum, and a domain expert will annotate question-answer pairs. A model already trained on SQuaD will be fine-tuned on the custom DellQA dataset. The study aims to address the scarcity of closed-domain QA datasets and demonstrate the feasibility of domain adaptation for IT support.
