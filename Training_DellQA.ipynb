The specsheet.pdf for the server states 5600 \\\"SERIES\\\" both of which are more easy to locate than the .pdf you linked to (i.e. Google Poweredge t410)The technicalguide.pdf you linked to only solidifies my sentiment that Dell needs to be more clear about their documentation. Example 6.1 Overview (table 8) The Poweredge t410 provides support for up to two processors. It then lists 95 watt and 130 watt.\\u00a0Furthermore it gives reference to a set of supported processors but only goes up to the X5650. It gives no reference of what BIOS version was used during testing, however the date-stamp on the .pdf indicates July of 2011 but the newest BIOS version is from 2013. I hope with these examples you will be able to see that simply \\\"assuming\\\" things as \\\"good indicators\\\" can trip-up the most seasoned Sys Admins.And FWIW the X5675's are the fastest highest watt TDP processors that can run in the T410.

And no doubt you have seen the many posts on such topics with the many hit/miss outcomes. In another posts you asked about removing the management card (which in some systems is a pci card laid flat on the motherboard and contains the ES1000 graphics amongst other functions). But there is no mention of such a card on the T100 hardware owners manual so it doesn't seem to have one to remove.And the odd thing in the HOM is that on page 106 we see,\\\"Trouble Shooting Video Subsystem,Action 2. Determine whether the system has an expansion card with a video output connector. In this system configuration, the monitor cable should normally be connected to the connector on the expansion card, not the system's integrated video connector. To verify that the monitor is connected to the correct video connector, turn off the system and wait for 1 minute, then connect the monitor to the other video connector and turn the system on again\\\".Hardly a statement that clarifies much! I would expect that if the BIOS actually does not allow one to disable the integrated video, then there should be a clear statement that video expansion cards are not supported and that the system's integrated video connector should always be used. My only suggestion is to try the NVS300 in the x8 PCIe slot and if that fails, try a cheap ATI based x16 PCIe consumer card of similar vintage to the ES1000 (but this would require cutting a slot on the card's connector to allow it to fit into the x8 slot). Again this may still have conflicts and fail to work so it's a suck it and see approach. A second hand ATI x16 PCIe card can be had for very little outlay (but always test it works in a desktop PC before your start to hack away). View solution in original post\",\n",

However the update still failed (on both systems).I then scheduled the update for a regular patch round, and applied immediately after reboot. It then worked fine on both systems.Strange given that the I/O on startup was very high as services are starting and the Exchange store is mounting, but the update still completes OK.Therefore to assist anyone experiencing this issue, it is definitely recommended to take the advice of applying immediately after a restart of the server (regardless of I/O).The invalid image file error message is misleading, as it implies there is something wrong with the update itself, corruption or otherwise. There does appear to be a correlation with the length of time the server has been running and the failure of the update, regardless of I/O, which a reboot fixes.Anyway, problem now solved! Hope this helps other people in future.View solution in original post\",\n",

I can only say this came from Dell this way as the only time processor 1 was removed was in troubleshooting putting the 2nd one in. It seems that I never checked to see if there was anything wrong because the processor was working was no issues in slot 1.... However after checking there was 8 pins bent. I used sharp flat tweezers to pry them up and reposition them in place... put both processors in and BAM!!!!! It booted no errors.Question.... how the [ADMIN NOTE: Profanity removed] did it function with 8 pins not touching or crossed. How did I not get vm kernel crashes. lolThank You all for all your help. I am going to say its solved because I am the OP, however please continue troubleshooting your issues.Thanks againJessyView solution in original post\",\n",

And it may be that Dell has not done what's needed within UEFI firmware configuration for pcie graphics to even work... UEFI is outside my knowledge area...But one problem you will find is that when you install a non dell certified card, fans will go nuts but at least Dell has provided IMPI commands to disable such an aggressive fan responce.Below is comments pulled from post 6 which explains the issue and how to fix it on centos based systems.Similar is possible on Windows server OS though some components may need to be installed (links below).Good luck,...** Description: The default automatic cooling response on PowerEdge 13G server for third-party PCIe cards provisions airflow based on common industry card requirements.

So while the Support site said one thing, I needed another.I did try the HTTPs method earlier when my firmware was 7.6.x and it did not reveal any updates. It wasn't until I updated to 7.10.18 for the NICs that the HTTPS method revealed the further update to 15.15.8 for that card, which is the latest greatest.

Since this VRTX/Switch \\\"assembly\\\" is carrying user loads successfully (clean switch ports, no errors or drops etc.), and the issue follows the server across slots, and the firmware and drivers are all as 'matching' as I know to make them, and I have re-seated the card itself...I guess the card is bad.

I spent the whole weekend over the solution to this problem, and yet I solved it.Since my service was on virtual machines, I made snapshots and put out everything. Then I just reinstalled everything from scratch, the systems and roles, and as a result, the error did not reproduce, as it turned out Dell's physical servers had nothing to do with it. But I was wondering what was the cause of the previous problem, in the end it turned out that the service of a certain Dell utility, which remained after the P2V server virtualization, was spinning on port 443, I deleted it, deleted the port ACL. I found this hint on a site with methods to eliminate 503 errors. Maybe this will help someone not to spend two days looking for a problem.View solution in original post\",\n",

The BMC is programmed to run fan speeds within a certain threshold based on system configuration. A minimal configuration will have a low fan speed minimum, and will increase up and down with system temperature. A maximum configuration will have a higher minimum fan speed.I don't have access to the exact settings the BMC is programmed for, but different CPUs can change the minimum fan speed settings. You might want to try reflashing the BIOS and BMC/iDRAC, and also clear NVRAM to make sure there is nothing corrupted in memory. If you still encounter the same fan speeds then that is what the BMC/iDRAC is programmed for.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post\",\n",

The PERC S-series are only supported under Windows, but if you have a PERC H710 or H310, you may need to check if FreeNAS 9.2 has support for this specific raid controller. If not, you'll want to check how you would add a driver for this specific raid controller to the FreeNAS installer.
