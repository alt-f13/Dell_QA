"(hope i'm posting at the correct location)Hi guys,i got some PowerEdge R740 servers waiting for firmware update. My current firmware version is quite old, about 2 years ago.The components on these R740 are:(got from iDRAC)Power Supply.Slot.(PN:0Y26KXA02),Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller,Intel(R) Gigabit 4P I350-t Adapter,Intel(R) Ethernet 10G 4P X710 SFP+ rNDC,BIOS,Dell HBA330 Adp,SATASSD/SAS HDD,BP14G+ 0,Lifecycle Controller,Dell 64 Bit uEFI Diagnostics,Dell OS Driver Pack,OS COLLECTOR,iDRAC Service Module Installer,System CPLD For now, I could only find firmware updates for these components: iDRAC、BIOS、HBA adapter、SAS HDD、10G NIC、1G NIC、CPLD、Internal Dual SD Module, therefore, these are the only components gonna be updated. Just saw this recommended firmware update order: https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/zh-tw/000121875/dell-poweredge-update-server-firmware-for-optimal...However, I couldn't find the ""PERC"", ""powersupply"" or ""Chipset"" firmware, and not so sure about whether this applies to my R740 or not?I'm planning to update the firmware in the following sequence: iDRAC->HBA->10G NIC->1G NIC->BIOS->SAS HDD->SD Module->CPLD Note that the OS installed on my R740 server is ESXi 7. Can anyone give advice about the correctness of my update order please?thanks in advance!",doc_1

"---This is my very first Server project. I am grateful for the chance to learn. I hope that my first post here may be useful to others, but it probably contains more questions than answers:---I found a great deal online for a used barebones R930 kit. I think it may have included much more than most barebones kits usually do.The kit was heavily discounted, because it had a damaged and unreadable LCD screen.I fixed the broken LCD with an inexpensive replacement part designed for R920 and that has worked fine.Vendor stated that it is only necessary to add CPU and Memory.---Barebones kit included:R930 chassis and motherboardpre-installed H730P RAID Controller with cablingpre-installed 16+8 HDD backplane with two daughter cardspre-installed Network Cardpre-installed 4x 1100 Watt Power Supplies with power cords8 x memory risersDVD-ROM---I purchased and installed used 8 x SNPCPC7GC/32G 32GB DDR4 2400MHz ECC RDIMM Memory (supported basis Dell Parts upgrade list for R930)I also purchased and installed used quad INTEL XEON E7-8890V4 ES PROCESSOR E7-8890 V4 60M Cache 24-core 2.20 GHz (supported basis Dell Parts upgrade list for R930)I purchased and installed used left-side cabling and right-side cabling for 8x PCIe NVM backplaneI purchased and installed only 1 used Samsung XS1715 1.6TB 2.5"" NVMe SSD DELL MZ-WEI1T60---On startup, I have observed that Dell R930 hangs at ""Initializing Intel QuickPath Interconnect"".iDRAC reports that BIOS 1.1.5 is preinstalled.---I hope that someone will correct me if I am wrong, but I will begin troubleshooting with the assumption that the existing BIOS 1.1.5 cannot support processors above Xeon E7 v3. My assumption is based on a common sense interpretation of release notes for BIOS v2.0.1, which announce new support for Xeon E7 v4 if I am not mistaken.If my assumption is correct, then it seems that I should upgrade the BIOS to version 2.0.1 in order to support the quad Xeon E7 8890 v4 processors which are currently installed on the R930 motherboard.Based on my reading of how to upgrade a BIOS, it seems that a system must be able to boot in order to upgrade a BIOS. Is that really true? It would be problematic in my case, because I would need to purchase unwanted Xeon v3 processors just to boot the system, simply to upgrade the BIOS, and then reinstall the desired Xeon v4 processors.---Any suggestions from the Community would be welcome. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.---",doc_3
A 4-server VRTX was shipped to us that already was functioning properly in another facility. I am new to servers so not sure where to begin with understanding how to use it. I plugged in three network cables into it and it seemed to acquite a public IP address. I can log in to the chasis management console with this IP address from my laptop.I can see the four server have been assigned some local IP address like 192.168.0.121 . But obviously those aren't accessible from our network. How can I get the individual servers assigned a public IP address like the Chasis got?,doc_4
"A few hours ago, one of the nodes on a Dell C6100 4 node server stopped responding while I was actively working on it. After 5 hours of troubleshooting, here is what I have found...- No video output- Because there is no video output, the BIOS is not accessible- Cleared CMOS, same story- Reseated and shuffled all the RAM - nothing- Ping / traceroute timeoutHowever, the node is receiving power from the backplane. The IPMI ethernet port's activity lights turn on as soon as the node is plugged into the chassis and the blue indicator light appears when the indicator button is pressed on the front bezel. When the power button is pressed, the HDD lights go green and it spins up but the eth0 port still shows no activity. Essentially, the server is receiving power but does not boot with no signs of error LEDs or beeping errors.IPMI is accessible via the web however the event log only shows http://d.pr/i/pPK5 and power control via that interface fails as well.IPMI firmware: 1.22BIOS version: Not sure, can't access itIs this a bricked motherboard that should just be replaced?",doc_5
"A few months ago, I purchased a PowerEdge T320 with an H310 RAID controller and hot-plug chassis. Like a few other people in this forum, I am disappointed with the performance of the H310, and I am considering to upgrade it to the H710p. The H310 is a full-height PCIe card with two connectors which are cabled up to the hot-plug hard-drive chassis. I would appreciate it if somebody could advise the part number for the H710p-equivalent, so I can simply disconnect the H310 and remove it, and then insert the H710p in its place with the same connectors etc and then import foreign config.Thanks in advance",doc_6
"A friend gave me an R730xd. It was working fine before he brought it here (I was logging in remotely to it). Something must have happened during transport, because now both power supplies are blinking amber and it won't power on. I know both power supplies didn't suddenly go bad, so it must be something else, but I have no idea what it could be. I tried re-seating everything I could, but that didn't help.Other symptoms: The middle fan briefly comes on and then turns off. The 4 Ethernet ports blink, but not the iDRAC8 port. I tried resetting the iDRAC8 using the info button, but I still can't ping it at 192.168.0.120.It's out of warranty and I don't want to spend a lot of money fixing it, but it would be a shame to throw it out.",doc_7
"A technician removed an expansion card riser (the only one) from the dual-CPU PowerEdge R630 server in our remote data center. The server now runs with no risers installed and reports critical health alert ""HWC2005 System board Riser cable or interconnect failure. Check connection"". VMware ESXi hypervisor which is installed on this server runs normally (apparently).Owner's manual says: ""A System Event Log (SEL) event is logged if an expansion card riser is unsupported or missing. It does not prevent your system from turning on and no BIOS POST message or F1/F2 pause is displayed.""Troubleshooting guide says: ""Typically, the minimum to POST configuration for rack servers is PSU1, CPU1, memory module in A1 slot, and the default riser without expansion cards"". To the best of my knowledge, this was true until and including 11G PowerEdge rack servers. It also contradicts the statement in the Owner's manual.However, neither manual gives an explanation about the eventual consequences of running a PowerEdge R630 server with no expansion card risers installed.So my question is, will the R630 run normally without any expansion card riser installed, i.e. is such a configuration supported by Dell ?",doc_8

After working nights and nights on this I have came to the conclusion that the nvidia's apparently have problems with black screening after windows logo.  This is very frustrating but I would really like some help.  I want to get the Pci Express x1 NVS 300 video card to work in my T100 with Windows 7 x64 installed.  I installed the supplied driver and after restart it goes black after windows booting logo. I reboot into safemode and the video is working. I installed the latest NVidia drivers released in Feb 2012. I restart and it goes black. I go back into safemode and made sure windows aero features where off (they already were). I try a bunch more older version from Nvidia and it goes black. I switched a few irq's around in the bios and it goes black. I have no idea what these drivers are doing that causes a black screen but I can not figure it out. I have searched google a ton and a lot of things I tried came from reading other forum posts so I am hoping a Dell guy/gal will step in on this forum.  I have tried it with the vga adapter on my dell lcd monitor and the dvi adapter on my dell lcd monitor. I actually have two slightly different dell lcd monitors and both them have the same issue. I have the card in my pcix 1 slot and that is the only card installed on the motherboard. I have also tried the card in the x4 slot and it comes up but Windows marks it as having a hardware issue and disables the driver.  I just updated my bios to the newest one suggest on my Dell T100 support page which is PET100-010401C and that did not fix anything.Can someone help me?,doc_23

"Alright, so I'm over exaggerating, but I still am stuck. I have 4 newly squired servers from my college. They are: POWEREDGE 2900 - with 2 dual core Xeon 3.2GHz - 4GB of RAM - and a RAID0 config - x3 146GB 10,000 RPM 3GB/s HDD's adding up to about 446GB of space.POWEREDGE 2800 - with 2 dual core Xeon 2.8GHz - 8GB of RAM - and a RAID0 config - x5 36.4GB 15,000 RPM 3GB/s adding up to about 160GB of space.POWEREDGE 2600 - with 2 single core Xeon 2.4GHz - 3GB of RAM - single RAID0 config - x1 73.4GB 10,000 RPM 3GB/s.POWEREDGE 2600 - with 2 single core Xeon 2.4GHz - 1.5GB of RAM - single RAID0 config - x1 73.4GB 10,000 RPM 3GB/s.So basically, I would like to know what I can do with these. I am hoping I can do something with the 2600's like use them as a small render farm for Blender? Is that possible? And the 2900 with Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, I am already using as a dedicated media server hosting films and making accessible with Apache2 as a website. As for the last 2800, it also has Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS running as a game server for MINECRAFT.Don't get me wrong, all this is working absolutely perfect. I just don't see these as using them to their full potential. I mean, com'on, I have 4 PowerEdge servers! Freaking beasts, even if they are a little old (okay a lot old). So in all, like I stated, I just would like to know if this can happen and what they can really do.

Everything worked without problemsUpgraded to dual E5-v4 cpus (E5-2697v4) without changing anything else.Bios, and all firmware is up to date using idrac to update. Bios version 2.16.0Now only ram in slots to the left of the CPU show up at all. Slots to the right of the bios show errors when posting that the memory in slot XX had a recoverable training error and to try reseating the dimms.For example, install eight 8GB sticks of 1Rx8 Ram following manual  in A1,A2,A3,A4,B1,B2,B3,B4.A1,A2,B1,B2 doesnt show up, but does in A3,A4,B3,B4. Bios only reports 32GB of ram. Lifesycle controller -> system assessment only shows ram in A3,A4,B3,B4All of the slots to the left of the CPU show up, all of the slots to the right of the cpu do not.If i go back to the E5-v3 cpus, everything works normal. all ram in all slots show up. If I try single E5-v4 cpu configuration, for both cpus, same issue. So it is not the mobo, the ram, or the cpu at the hardware level that is causing the problem (to my knowledge)I also tried entirely different 1Rx4 ram and same issue.  Also, The ram only runs at 1866 speed, despite all the dimms being 2400T speed and exactly the same (all 1Rx8 and all same mfg) Cant figure this one out. The memory configuration is set to optimizer mode, so it isnt one of the weird modes where only half the ram shows up to the OS. Here is a photo of what i mean on left of the cpu. All sticks in this image show up properly, but any sticks put in the slots occupied by blanks do not show up. Even if the memory configuration is correct according to the manual Please let me know if I can provide any other info.Thanks! ",doc_49

"Dear Dell Community,I am new to the dell community. Recently I procured a new dell r720 server with two intel xeon six-core processors, 64 GB RAM, 2TBx4 SAS HDD with PERC H710P and an Nvidia Quadro K2000 GPU. Since the day it has arrived we have been able to successfully install CentOS 6.6 OS and every thing seems to be working fine. However, I would like to know as how I should proceed with the following matter:During boot when I see the dell logo and the progress bar on my screen, if I press the F2 key to enter the system options, I get a blank screen with a cursor blinking in the top left corner of my screen. The system stays in this state until I power it off by pressing the power button or restart the machine by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Del. The same thing happens when I press the F11 key for PXE boot.During boot when the system prompts to press the Ctrl-S key for network options and the Ctrl-R for RAID options, I can successfully access the network and RAID configurations.If I insert a dvd and press no keys during the boot for accessing any options, the machine reads the dvd and I am able to install my OS. Is there some setting which need to be made or is there a hardware fault. How can I diagnose this issue? I hope I have expressed issue clearly. If any further information is required please do not hesitate to ask.Best RegardsSohaib ",doc_85
"Dear DellI am getting misinformation from your sales staff in Hong Kong. I am a corporate (education) customer and I just bought a PowerEdge R650. Simply, I want to add M.2 NVME drives which are standard and easy to find nowadays to my machine.In addition to the product taking six months to arrive, the staff did not understand the difference between an M2 and M2 NVMe drive thus selling me a BOS card which I didn't need. So I bought hard drives to use it, fine.They did not make available to me the rearbay option during the sales process.They told me over the phone that my cutting edge server won't support M.2 NVME, only 2.5 inch NVME. This is unfathomable.Now, they refuse to sell me the rear bay, going so far (and I have email to prove this) that indicates they believe the Poweredge R650 cannot install rear bay SSDs. It clearly plainly can from the documentation and from the Poweredge website in the US that there is a rear bay that supports 2.5 x 2 NVME drives.  They cannot answer simple questions like where the Rearbay will go, can you use a rear bay and a boss card at the same time. I have asked this over email.When I asked to buy rear bay for nvme drives. they instead show me M.2 sized Nvme drives, which contradicts the statement made over the phone. They refuse to provide a quote, despite me simply asking for the rearbay configuration. This has gone on for weeks. They are slow to respond, do not call back, and do not communicate clearly. I understand HK is not the biggest market for corporate servers, but it is impossible to reach Dell's support staff in the US for very simple basic questions.",doc_86

"First-time poster here, after exhausting all my googling abilities I am stuck. I have an R820 that I received second hand and it appears that the backplane was never used by its first owner, as none of the power/signal/SAS cables were connected, and the bays were all filled with blanks. The server would boot and run fine off a USB flash drive, but when attempting to connect a RAID card and make use of the backplane I continuously get stuck on the Initializing Firmware Interfaces screen.  Looking in the idrac logs the following exception occurs around the time in which the server appears to hang. In an attempt to remedy the issue I tried first removing the raid card, which allowed the system to boot normally. Replacing the generic raid card with an H200A yielded the same results as the other card, and the H200A was pulled from a working system moments before in an attempt to isolate the issue.  Furthermore, this only happens when the raid card is connected and a logical disk is configured. Destroying the array and attempting to boot allows the system to post and boot fine. I'm at my wits end on this one, as I can't figure out why a healthy raid array would cause a system hangup like this. All firmware is current to my knowledge, the lifecycle controller does not report any updates available. I unfortunately don't have any extra hardware to test with beyond what I have already done.  I have tried fully resetting the system to factory defaults using the built-in method on the lifecycle controller, as well as continuously trying to change settings and power cycling the system to see if I could find any conflicts within the BIOS. Another weird artifact I found during the process was that when trying to boot in UEFI mode, the raid configuration utility will never be loaded. Upon requesting the array config utility during startup, I get a message stating that the utility will load after firmware initialization is complete, but after initializing I get dumped straight into the boot sequence.  Happy to post any further explanations/logs/photos upon request. Any help is greatly appreciated! ",doc_137
"Fixed.... Sorry Dell messed with all my formatting lolSo I originally bought 5 identical R620's.I just replaced all the 8GB Dimm's in my production servers with 16GB DIMM's, so obviously I have a lot of spare of RAM.I went to install it in my 2 DR Servers.Loaded up the first one so it now has 24 x 8GB Dimm's.....Then I moved to the second..... to load it up with 12 more 8GB DIMM's.But I discovered I had added 4 x 16GB Dimm's to the original 12 x 8GB Dimm configuration (16 DIMM's total). Done so long ago I forgot lol.It's dell RAM, since I would have had them spec it out and my server guy on our account advise on the physical layout.(However I have to say the placement does seem odd..... but the memory layouts on servers now does give me a headache lol)1) Now first is a simple question and I'm 100% sure the answer is no since I have 2 CPU's but if someone can confirm.Trying to split this up and use 2 - 16GB dimm's in each server definitely won't work right?2) Second question is should I leave the 16's where the are and just pop in more 8's in the remaining 8 slots? Or do some or all of these 16GB's need to be moved?(Yes, I know mixing sizes isn't recommended but this is expensive RAM I'm not going to rip it out and stick it on a shelf. Plus it's worked this long.)Here is the current configuration (the other server is exactly the same except right now it has 24x 8GB DIMM's):Server - R620 (2 x Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630)Memory - 2RX4 PC3L - 1066R (Dual Rank)A1    8GB       B1    16GBA2    8GB       B2     8GBA3 16GB        B3    16GBA4    8GB       B4     8GBA5    8GB       B5     8GBA6    8GB       B6     8GBA7    8GB       B7     8GBA8    16GB     B8     8GBA9    Empty    B9     EmptyA10  Empty    B10  EmptyA11  Empty    B11  EmptyA12  Empty    B12  EmptyI'm assuming A8 and A1 should be reversed.I'm myself or my admin just messed up installing them but I don't want to move anything yet until I know.I do know the rule is keeping larger DIMM's closest to the CPU's channel wise right?Thanks in advance,Kenneth Morrissey",doc_138

Both BIOS and iDRAC are on the latest versions. I'm slightly at a loss as to how to update the PCIe device firmware (suggested further down the error message) if I can't get the server to recognise the card in the first place.The card doesn't have any additional power ports and recommends a 200W power supply (the server has 750W supplies), so I am assuming (perhaps wrongly) that the GPU upgrade kit is not required.Any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong much appreciated.

"Greetings,How does one update the firmware on the NDC of a M620 (G12) for PEVRTX?I know there is an update as my working blades have NDC firmware 7.10 and the blade I need to update is at 7.6 for the NDC.

The platform specific firmware-updating boot CD. I used the iDRAC console, mapped the iso file, and booted off it per the instructions. It ran for 35 minutes, tried and failed to update the firmware for a backplane, then failed and bailed.2. I tried the iDRAC HTTPS method using downloads.dell.com. It offered me a diags package update and a ""driver-for-OS' package but no firmware updates at all. Not even the one the CD tried to install for the backplane...so another fail.3. Tried the iDRAC ""item specific"" method but both .bin files I found on the support site (using the service tag and selecting ""Networking"" and ""VMware 6.5"" as my criteria, one gets offered .bin files as  opposed to .exe files when Windows is chosen as the OS filter) for this M620 returned the ""RAC0613 file invalid"".

"Hello All! I am Dan, and I am a newbie here. I am a SysAdmin for a school district.A DIMM issue has been bugging me for a couple of weeks now.My R820 has 4xCPUs and 32x8GB DIMMs (256GB total). They appear to be DDR3 1600MHz Registered ECC low-profile DIMMs ""D3-60NN102MLV-11"".One of them seems to have gone bad. Whatever I do in OS is very slow.When I reboot, the BIOS screen with Dell logo takes 7 min.Front panel message: MEMO701 Correctable memory rate exceeded for DIMM_D3.Warranty on this machine has expired.At this point, I would like to purchase a correct DIMM.My quick browse on the www stores suggests that a used 8MB stick costs about $50. This seems like a rip-off to me.So, I seek your expert opinion on where should I order my DIMM. Can I still order from Dell easily?Thank You.-Dan",doc_210

"",he replied"" Hi, £5 each is best what we can do ""   Obviously i thought bargain!! im doubling up my ram for only £60  ( plus £14 post n packing )Well the memory arrived ( see pic below )As you can see.When i installed the new modules, the server refused to boot and just kept sticking on the Configuring memory screen,ending up taking them out and leaving just the original 12 modules in and the server booted up fine without issues.I then took out the original modules and installed just the new modules in their place and again i am stuck on the configuring memory screen.Are they damaged modules, or incompatiable or something or do i need to change a setting in the bios The codes on the both are as follows:Original : 16GB 2Rx4 PC3-12800R-11-11-E2-DE  CODE M393B2G70BH0-CK0    1221New       : 16GB 2Rx4 PC3-12800R-11-11-E2-P2  CODE M393B2G70BH0-CK0Q9    M 1240 Is there any hope of getting these two to run together?   are the new ones faulty?  am i a philbert?  ( dont answer that one lol )  i assume its my error and not the fault of the seller?

"Hello Everyone,I have, in my homelab, a Poweredge R320 for more than a year now and it always worked well. Two days ago, the server rebooted suddenly with an PWR2402 error. After this reboot, the error disappeared, but the iDRAC interface was not available, neither by the webinterface nor by ping. (iDRAC 7 Express).After several tests, the iDRAC seems to be working when the server is powered off or when it starts for the first time after plugging power cords, but as soon as ESXi boots, the iDRAC interface is not responding anymore.I already tried to: - Change iDRAC IP and even put in a VLAN with only my PC and the iDRAC interface (to avoid a possible IP conflict). Same problem - Dedicate a NIC for iDRAC and another one for ESXi Mgt Network (all my VM already had a dedicated NIC). Same problem - Soft resetting iDRAC from ""Racadm"" utility in VMWare. - Update iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller to latest version available for my server (2.65.65). Same problem - Power off the server and unplug power cords for 1 min, while pressing the power button. iDRAC works until ESXi boots up - Boot a Windows PE on a USB stick. iDRAC works even after Windows booting.My last changes on this server was last month, but I don't think that's the cause: - Changing CPU to a E5-2470V2 - Updating ESXi 6.7 to 6.7U3, enabling SNMP on the iDRAC interface to monitor it.Do you think that a full iDRAC reset (and wiping my config) will be a solution?

It runs successful then asks me to reboot. Once rebooted it mentions that the BIOS update attempt failed.3) Created a bootable USB flashdrive. Copied the un-packaged file called ""R710-060004C.EXE"" to the USB flashdrive and renamed the file to conform to the 8.3 format. Booted to the USB flash drive and ran the program. It verifies the program then immediately fails with the error ""cannot use a dell system poweredge r710 bios in a "" -  "".4) Tried updating from a non-bootable USB drive through system services using Unified Server Configurator.

This causes, as far as I know, a loss of service for the traffic going through those interfaces (switch sees the flap, and so does DMESG). [ 9681.468245] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none[ 9681.468249] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9681.468289] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9681.468291] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9684.796878] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9684.796882] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9686.076420] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Down[ 9686.327785] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Down[ 9686.328264] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Down[ 9687.848387] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9687.848391] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9688.113243] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9688.113247] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9690.414869] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none[ 9690.414873] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9693.494675] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Down[ 9693.749108] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Down[ 9694.000669] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Down[ 9695.534315] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9695.534319] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9695.534438] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9695.534442] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9696.558854] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none[ 9696.558858] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: FEC autoneg off encodings: None(Weirdly, the eno8303np0 doesn't flap now, but it did earlier, the only difference I can see is that this interface has a static IP, while the others are used for L2 traffic and bridged to virtual interfaces). The servers are running Ubuntu Server 20.04.5 and one of them has the latest 22.31.13.70 firmware provided by Dell installed, while the other has a slightly lower version.

"Hello all,Thanks in advance for helping out a complete newbie to server architecture. I'm an experienced custom desktop PC builder for almost two decades, but I recently purchased a used R510 and have realized I have much to learn! This server is being used in my home, not a business setting.Objectives: Setup remote management, as this system will be headless once installed in a rackInstall FreeNAS on mirrored 2.5"" HDD's in the internal drive caddyUse all 12 front 3.5"" drive bays for 8TB WD Reds, this will be my FreeNAS arrayBackground:Here's an ongoing thread I have over at the FreeNAS forums, in case it is useful for reference, or anyone is trying to emulate what I'm attempting and find it useful reading.Here's a link to my Dell Service Tag so you can see how the server was configured from Dell. The server currently is setup in a RAID configuration using the H700 with 10 drives combined into a single virtual drive. That drive has Windows Server 2016 Standard installed and activated on it. There's also an iDrac Enterprise card installed. Questions:My goal is to place this server in a rack, but still want to keep an eye on thermals, power consumption, software updates and so forth over my home network. Once configured, I want to make the system completely headless.The system already has iDrac Enterprise card installed, but no vFlash SD card. I'd like to make a backup of the server's current system configuration before I make any changes to it. There are 10 Dell SAS HDD's (lower capacity than the WD Red's I want to use for FreeNAS) currently installed with the RAID config for Windows Server 2016.Is there any easy way to export this current hardware configuration via USB thumb drive before I remove all the Dell drives and swap them out with the WD Reds? I tried exporting the server configuration, but it gave me an error message about needing a licensed Dell vFlash card. I had just a standard SD card in the slot, but the only other option that seemed to be available was export to CDROM, of which there was none attached to the system. How does one select USB thumb drives as an export destination for server configuration files? I'd like to save a copy of the current RAID config, plus Windows Server installation information in case I ever wanted to repurpose the server away from FreeNAS and swap out drives to go back to its original Windows Server 2016 configuration. How do I setup the iDrac management to use OMSA?Once FreeNAS (based upon FreeBSD) is installed, I won't have any Windows environment to install Windows-based utilities. Based on my reading (someone correct me if I'm wrong!) OMSA needs to be installed on both the management station (my primary Windows 10 desktop) and on the R510 too, inside of Windows.Can one take full advantage of the remote management features without having an operating system installed? If so, how does one start to configure this?I've read that iDrac Enterprise works in a pre-OS environment, which is exactly how I'd want to access it once FreeNAS is installed. What needs to be installed/configured on the R510 to make this happen? What needs to be installed/configured on my Windows 10 desktop to access it once configured, or can everything on the management desktop be done over a web-browser? Those are my main concerns right now, and if anyone can point a complete server beginner in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it. I realize I have much to learn. Thank you for your assistance!",doc_253

"Hello and thanks in advance for any help and suggestions.I've got a PE-T620 With CentOS on a 500GB (4PD) RAID1 array and 10TB storage (4PD) RAID 10 array.The last disk on my storage array was flashing amber. The PERC utility showed SMART errors were present, all info about amber flashing said predictive failure, and processes that involved moving large packets of data were extremely slower than usual.The 4 drives in my RAID10 array are WL5000GSA6454 (5TB SATA III). I misplaced the spare I had in my IT closet so I shopped all over not finding a 5TB SATA / NAS drive that could be delivered anytime in this century. I ended up getting a 6TB thinking it will rebuild the array using 5TB and I'd waste 1TB but at least the array would be healthy and we'd recover lost performance.When the drive arrived, I was unsure about hot swap-ability so I went into the PERC utility to see if I could force the drive offline. There was an option but the warning message said doing so would ruin my array. The other option was ""replace member"", when I chose it, the message said, ""No spare configured"". Since all my bays are in use, I can't configure a spare.I ended up turning the server off, replacing the drive, and booting back up. No lights on the new drive carriage during boot or otherwise. I went back into PERC and it just says MISSING DISK. I put the old drive in, still says MISSING DISK. I don't see any option to add a new disk, initialize the new disk, or do anything that seems conducive.The data on that RAID10 array is mission critical. We have online backups but I'd much rather just get the array rebuilt with this new drive if possible.Either I'm missing some setting or option to get the drive going, or I have to get the same drive as the other 3 in the array. My experience with RAID says as long as the drive is equal or larger than the other members it can be used, but if it's bigger, we'll only be able to utilize as much space as the smallest member in the array.Right now the OS is bootable with that 4th PD missing but I have it off because I'm scared something may happen that will result in data loss or worse.Any help would be greatly appreciated! ",doc_260

"Hello everyone and sorry for any grammar errors, not my primary language and this is kinda edge case so please bear with me As title says -  my machines suffered from a ball lightning damage.

Due financial reasons i currently cannot afford to buy another motherboard for the T610, on top on that there is none available anywhere within reasonable distance near me.I do however have the equipment and skills to fix it. After some fiddling around i managed to bring it back to life by removing the integrated nic IC (the bcm5709cc0kpbg chip got toasted as expected and it was shorting the MB).  While diagnosing the machine i had to do the minimal boot attempt several times, and after all other stuff got properly detected (all ram modules, the two cpus etc) after POST i get ""PCIe Training Error: Embedded NIC1"". All of the solutions i found online assume there's some pcie problems / incompatible hardware, but in my case it's obvious that the chip is not there. Is there any way i can boot the machine without the integrated NIC ?I have some options, like plug a random broadcom lan card into the PCIe and pray, or probably buy a PCIe card with the same chip, remove it from the card, ball it and replace it on the MB, but that's something I'd like to avoid at near-all cases, because I'm fairly sure there's other damages from the lightning (as expected).

I noticed a flashing light going from green to amber on one of the HD's of my PowerEdge R720. We are under warranty so a new drive is in the mail right now. Once I receive it, physically replacing it seems easy enough. Its what I have to/should do before/after the replacement that I'm lost on. My predecessor, who retired after 14 years, did not keep a record of setup/maintenance or anything about these servers. We use VSphere for VMs and based on the iDRAC, it looks like those may be on on these servers. We also have an EqualLogic device that houses all the data.I was able to get a hold of my predecessor and he said that it may be setup as a redundant RAID and that the new drive might ""rebuild itself"" once installed. Seems like a risk to just assume he's right, but maybe it's that easy.What info can I provide to you guys to help determine what needs to be done. I've included a couple screenshots of the iDRAC UI but am unsure if this is the detail you need.   I will be watching this thread like a hawk so I will get you the info you need ASAP.

"Hello!Having used HP servers before when I needed a new server for a project I decided to try a Dell PowerEdge instead. So I went ahead and ordered a brand new PE T710 tower server in lightweight configuration (1x XEON E5506, 4GB RAM, 1x 250GB SATA hot-plug, PERC H200 controller, 1 PSU). The server arrived 6 weeks ago, but due to my workload I have only recently found enough time to test it and set it up.The main problem is that this server has a really poorly designed cooling system which is deafening loud. I really have a low-end config, but even in idle the four Delta AFC0912DE fans (6000 rpm max, pushing a staggering 160 cfm and producing an insane 63db(A) noise level) run at 2040 and 2400 rpm in a room that is at 20 deg C, blowing a huge mass of cold air out of the back end and producing a nerve-wrecking noise. Had I bought a rack server (which is meant to sit in rack in a data center together with dozens of other servers) then I would not complain. However, I have bought a tower server which is meant to be placed in a standard office environment, something which is not possible with this thing. We have a few HP ProLiant tower servers (ML350 G5 and G6, ML370 G6), and even our much better spec'd ML370 G6 does not produce such an amount of noise even when under load.Since designing electronic components (aerospace) is part of my job, I had a closer look. Obviously the BMC is meant to be checking the temperature levels and adjusting fan rpm in accordance with heat levels. It seems to be badly done, though, as the exiting air temperature is the same as the intake air, which means there is very little heat transfer. A proper cooling design would keep the airflow just high enough to allow sufficient heat transfer from the components, which for this server with such a low end config would be at less than half the airflow (with the fans rotating at less than 1000rpm). Having the fans run at 2400rpm is not conservative, it is simply poor engineering, as the unnecessary high airflow not only creates noise but also increases fan wear and dust accumulation. This aside, I wonder why a two socket server like the T710 needs to have four 160 cfm fans @ 6000 rpm screaming at 63db(A) when a maxed out config (two fas 6-core XEONs, 144GB RAM, 8x 15k SAS HDDs) can be easily cooled with fans with much lower cfm rating like the AVC DS09238B12HPFAF (104 cfm @ 5000 rpm and 51 db(A)) or even the Delta T92E12BMA7-07 (83 cfm @ 4000 rpm and 43db(A)). And because for some reason Dell has decided to set the fan alarm threshold at 1080 rpm it's close to impossible to use other fans without triggering the low fan alarm. Overall I have to say I think this is a really poor design, especially for a device which is used in a noise conscious environment. And before someone asks: yes, latest BIOS is installed, as is the latest firmware for the BMC. Yes, I tried various fan performance settings in the BIOS without luck. And yes, I called Dell support, they looked into the problem but confirmed that the fan rpms are normal for this server. Unfortunately I'm over the 30 days return period, else I would have sent the thing back and bought HP instead. Does anyone know if there is a fix in form of a firmware/BIOS update in the works? Maybe not now that they're probably focussing on their new 12G servers due for Q1/2012. Any chance that someone from Dell reads this? ",doc_308

"Hello! I was comparing server characteristics (power consumption, noise levels, etc) with the Estimated Enterprise Infrastructure Planning Tool ( http://dell-ui-eipt.azurewebsites.net/#/ ).(Very helpful tool by the way, just not so much advertised -- took me a while to find it.)So, I was comparing a T440 and a R440, that both host a Xeon 4210 and 2x280GB SATA SSDs (RAID-1 with PERC H740P) and 16GB of RAM.It all seemed reasonable to me, with the rack server pulling a bit more power and amps, but then I noticed something weird in the ""Sound Power"" section.It appears that the tool always reports more bels (so more noise) for the T440 server.For example, with a transactional load and CPU load of 30%, the T440 is said to produce 6.3 bels, while the R440 5.6 bels.I found this very weird since --from what I know-- towers server are designed to operate inside offices where noise is not very tolerated and since rack servers usually have smaller fans that need to spin faster and produce more noise.So, here are my questions:Are those reported noise levels correct or I am missing something in the configuration? Here is a link to my configuration (see 2nd and 3rd server -- the 1st is a R6415 that I also compare): https://mega.nz/file/NYM1wYzJ#Mzg4JHThRpauUGjPH59HIWDG6-3Fypg-Ql4wlkBD-1Y If they are correct, that means that both rack servers in my solution are more silent than the T440 tower?I have some trouble understanding why 1P AMD processors (e.g. AMD EPYC™ 7351P) consume so much less power than the 2P EPYCs (one third of the 2P consumption!!!), but I guess that is some hardware peculiarity, not a flaw in the estimation software, correct?I am pretty new to servers and I wanted to host my wannabe business in a silent and energy-efficient model (I do not want to invest in rack enclosures or extra cooling).Initially, I was considering a tower, thinking that it would be most silent and most power efficient option, but looking at these estimations I am realizing that maybe the rack servers are more silent and that I should choose the R6415 as the most silent and energy efficient solution (although, it might be more expensive to buy...).I am a bit lost here, so any hints are welcome. P.S.:The R6415 seems to miss the ""Idle"" workload mode. It would be nice to have a comparison of it against other servers in this mode. But I guess that would put those other servers in shame, because it would consume less than 50 Watts?",doc_317

In Java it gives me always some session error when clicking to Map the disk and if not, then i dont see it after pushing F11 to see the Boot Device Menu, VIRTUAL CD-ROM is not there :/ seen it just once..Native almost always connects .iso, but I still dont see it in Boot Device MenuI am a bit confused what to do to make it work. I've user auto-attach and java [not native] and not sure what to use in Boot Once Option [Virtual Media / Disabled / PXE].

Turning “virtualization technology” and “execute disable” CPU features in BIOS on and off and on again (reboots in between) gave nothing. The BIOS interface doesn’t provide a way to adjust the “virtualization technology” any deeper, f.ex., enable or disable only VT-d or smth. as a part of VT. Some people out there have succeeded with it adjusting some particular CPU features in BIOS, but with PE R520 I can see to only turn VT feature ON or OFF as a whole, via OMSA or the console.Executing “bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto” with administrative privileges gave the same nothing.As experienced, Hyper-V on Windows 2008 R2, previously hosted on the platform, had none of such a weird complication.Among CPU attributes, everything is enabled but the “Demand Based Switching(DBS)” and “Turbo Mode” ones.Can I do anything aside of returning to W2008R2 to solve this issue and to make the Hyper-V on W2012R2 to work properly on R520?Or may it be the issue doesn’t have any roots in the R520 platform specifics?Some details:BIOS version: 2.7.0CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2440 0 @ 2.40GHz (1 piece)64 GB of DDR3 RAMThanks a lot for your attention in advance!",doc_358

I have also tried removing the old modules completely and putting the new modules in A1/B1 - this also results in no POST.

"Hello,I'm trying to update the IDRAC6 Enterprise of a PowerEdge M610 installed on a M1000e blade chassis. Actually the installed version is 3.65 and I'm trying to install the recently released 3.75.I'm having some troubles, I tried some different ways:- With ""System Update Utility"" from Windows 2012 R2- Executing the package ""ESM_Firmware_GR09H_WN32_3.75_A00.EXE"" from Windows 2012 R2- From chassis management using the payload ""firmimg.imc"" extracted from the package ""ESM_Firmware_GR09H_WN32_3.75_A00.EXE""- Using racadm and downloading the payload from TFTPEverytime it says that update succeeded but the version of the IDRAC is stil 3.65 Build 6. So update isn't applied correctly. Executing the package ""ESM_Firmware_GR09H_WN32_3.75_A00.EXE"" from Windows 2012 at the end of the procedure I get the message ""The update completed successfully."" but in the same window a strange message is shown: ""Device: iDRAC, Application: iDRAC Data File not recognized"" (as you can see in the screenshot attached).Someone can help me to solve this issue. All other updates from ""Server Update Utility"" are installed correctly.Thanks in Advance,Davide",doc_429

"Hello,I've a Dell PowerEdge 2600 (running Windows 2003), whom the RAID controller PERC 4/Di (integrated) appears to be faulty.I continually get the message ""Warning Embedded RAID firmware is not present"", while I bought a new PERC 4/Di kit whose I've tried all components (battery, memory module and PERC connector)!I've checked on the Web, and it sounds that this problem comes from motherboard.I've a RAID Controller Card ""Adaptec SCSI 39160"" (PCI-to-SCSI adapter) that came with this server and I've never installed.Is it possible to install this RAID Controller Card and use it with the original drive bays, included in this server?If yes, does this RAID Controller Card can function as the integrated PERC (via the motherboard)?Or, does this RAID Controller Card has to be connected to to SCSIA and SCSIB backplane board connectors?Thank you for your help :)Chris",doc_431
"Hello,I've previously purchased a PowerEdge T550, but opted to leave off the BOSS-S2 module at build time. Now that I've been running the system for a few months, I am working on reconfiguring how some of my drives are arranged - and plan to pass through the RAID controller and an HBA to a storage-focused VM. It seems the cleanest way to move the hypervisor out into its own separate controller (to avoid passthrough to the VM) would be to add the BOSS-S2 module. Looking at the parts available from the support page, I found the following: Dell BOSS-S2 Controller Card without Cable Dell 480GB SSD M2 SATA 6GB/s 512e Hard Drive - Single Stick I wanted to confirm a few things here before I put in the order:Is this BOSS-S2 card the same that would have come with the T550 originally? Looking at the manual, I see it slots in to a bay on the front. As there's no picture, it's hard to tell if it is the same one.The BOSS-S2 listing mentions ""without cable"". Is there a separate cable item I need to purchase? Is the cabling already present in the T550? I don't see a listing for ""BOSS-S2 Controller Card with Cable"".  Is the M.2 SSD I listed compatible with the BOSS-S2?I am working on the assumption that the BOSS-S2 will show up as a separate disk controller. Is that accurate? Thanks a lot in advance for any help. - Clay",doc_432
"Hello,I've reached the end of my rope trying to figure this out since I'm pretty new to what I'm dealing with. I've been after this for several days and I have no idea how to accomplish this.I'm used to the old school way of having to create DOS boot disks and whatnot to update firmware, but I haven't done any for years. I came into some ""luck"" and got a big case of white box Intel branded X710 quad port adapters. What I need is to update the firmware as they are quite old. I have the Intel firmware downloaded and it apparently runs from what is called an ""EFI Shell"".I do not have an EFI boot manager in any of my menus (not that I can find anyway) in order to use this utility. Iv'e tried using the utilities where you browse for a file on USB, but it doesn't like this file (nvmupdate64e.efi) for whatever reason and it just kicks me back out every time I select it. It appears that the functions I am trying to use is only for Dell BIOS updates, I'm just not sure.Can anyone help me with this? I need an explanation of how this works and how to achieve this. Of all the google hits, they all revolve around BIOS updates. I'm really hoping there is a way to do this, I just can't figure it out.",doc_433
"Hello,I've recently decided to upgrade the existing CPU installed on my old Dell Poweredge SC1430 with a second mathed CPU with the exact same specification.

"Hello,In setting up some new Dell R730 servers, I see there is an option to configure a dedicated IP address for the Lifecycle Controller, and it appears to use one of the Onboard NIC ports.  I am accustomed to always configuring a dedicated IP address for iDRAC Enterprise, but I've never configured a dedicated IP address for the Lifecycle Controller.  Could someone explain the purpose of assigning another dedicated IP for the LC?  What, specifically, does this provide in terms of functionality/capabilities that I cannot already access via iDRAC?  Also, I am using VMware vSphere, along with the Dell OpenManage Integration for VMware vCenter (OMIVV), which allows me to perform firmware updating and basic monitoring via vCenter.  I am curious if I am missing out on anything from a dedicated LC IP address.Thanks,Bill",doc_435

"Hello,On my PowerEdge 1950, I ran into a rather interesting issue. Once I install Ubuntu, the system does not boot unless the USB which I installed the system from is connected to the server and the server is booted via the USB. This issue happens regardless of the version of Ubuntu and regardless of whether it is 86 bit or 64 bit. I am sorry if the problem sounds hard to understand but English isn't my native language so I will try to explain my problem step by step from start up:1. I use Universal USB Installer 1.9.5.1 to allow me to install Ubuntu on the server. I tried using Ubuntu 13.10, 14.04 and 12.04 in both amd64 and i386 versions. 2. I check whether the installation works on a desktop. Everything works fine.3. I install the OS on the server. The installation runs successfully.4. The server reboots and gets stuck during boot up. To be specific, these are the last two lines I see:Press <Ctrl-E> for Remote Access Setup within 5 sec......_ (blinking cursor)5. The system does not respond to any input from the keyboard EXCEPT for Ctrl+Alt+Del to reboot the system.6. I reboot the system and iirc I press F11 to go to the boot menu and select booting from USB. 7. I see the purple Ubuntu loading screen and the system boots up.8. I can continue using the system as long as I don't have to reboot. This includes altering files, making directories, running commands, updating, upgrading and what not. I can also unplug the USB and the system still works, meaning that I couldn't have installed the system on the USB by accident (I triple checked the settings during installation).9. Upon reboot, I have to press F11 to boot from the USB otherwise the server hangs at the aforementioned point.What is interesting about this issue is the fact that I cannot use the USB on the same server to reinstall Ubuntu from it, however, if I plug it into my desktop, the files were not altered, ie: the files are laid out the same way the Universal Installer set them out as.I used this method in the past and it worked, even on the same server about 6 months ago. I am not sure how to solve this issue but I am pretty sure that there is no problem in the server itself as the system POSTs well without any errors, I can access all BIOS settings, etc. The only thing I am not sure of is the HDD as it seems to be the only piece of hardware which could be possibly messing up or maybe there are some options in the BIOS which are set up incorrectly, however, due to my limited knowledge, what I am saying may be very incorrect.Thanks for any tips, Milan",doc_438

"Hello,There is a seller on eBay unloading a bunch of servers listed as ""Dell FS12-NV7"" models. They have a hardware list of: 2x 6-core AMD processors, 32GB of RAM, 12 HDD trays (no drives included), dual gigabit ethernet (looks like on-board, not an addon card), and a 500W non-redundant power supply. I've googled and searched on dell's site, but I can't seem to find any information on this model. A couple of results push me towards EquiLogic systems, but I don't think that's what this is. Can anyone out there shed any light on what this is?If it pans out, I might pick one up to buy as an additional (or even replacement) ESX host and combine it with my current NAS. But I need to know what these things are before I bite :). The pictures have no service tag, and when I asked for one, the seller said there is no service tag or express service code on it at all, which struck me as odd.",doc_447

"Hello,We currently have a similar config, we have 6 x 4GB of RAM totaling 24GB. We would like to get as close to 64GB as possible. I found matching 4GB sticks on Newegg, but that would only get us up to 48GB if I added another 6 in the empty slots.I was looking at either doing a full replace of some 8GB sticks, but they are 2rX4, where what we have installed now is 2rx8. I am wondering if I bought 6 of those 8GB sticks, if I could use them in conjunction with what we have now if I matched config to channel?Currently we have sticks in slots A1-A2-A3 and B3-B2-B1.Wondering how best to go about it and still be optimal.",doc_450

"Hello,We have a Poweredge R910 with 128GB ram (32x4GB)Recently a dimm failed (E3 and E4), this resulted in only 96GB available mem (complete riser is disabled).We purchased spareparts via Dell and installed the new dimms for E3 and E4.After the installation, the system only shows 96GB and still gives the warning:Memory Initialization Warning: Memory size and/or performance may be reduced.Memory Riser E disabled - DDR training error.DDR training error: Memory Riser E DIMM 4Memory Riser E Lockstep Pair DIMM 3 & DIMM 4 disabled,Please replace the DIMM or remove the lockstep pair.This is the same warning before the replacement.After booting into the System menu (F10), i ran a memtest. This failed with a error like: There is still a warning in the eventlog, clear the eventlog.After clearing the event log, the system menu shows someting like: E3 & E4 replaced. And i'm able to run the memtest.I rebooted the system, but it still only shows 96GB and gives the same Memory Initialization Warning as described above.I think the memory is good and the error needs to be cleared/riser needs to be enabled.

"Hello,We have a T710 PowerEdge server running CentOS 6.9, with 8 SATA, 7200 rpm, 2.5 inch, 500 gig drives.One of the drives is indicating a failure. In the documentation I've been able to find, it looks like the failing drive needs to be marked for removal first, then removed, then replaced with the new drive.We have the new drive, but how do you mark the old drive for removal without having to power down the server and go into the RAID bios? We want to avoid downtime as much as possible.In a previous lifetime, I worked with PE servers running Windows, and Dell had a nice GUI application where this could have been done - does such an application exist for Linux?If I were to just yank the old drive and stick in the new drive without this ""mark for removal"" step, is that going to hose something in the RAID?",doc_455
"Hello,We have a pretty base level T420 server which had a single non-redundant power supply and 4x slot 3.5"" hard drive bay without a backplane.One day the power supply went down due to power surge. Looking online I figured that buying a new single power supply would cost about $500 which did not make sense. At the same time I found a redundant kit with 2 power supplies for a quarter of the price and I got it.When I installed it I found that the redundant power supply kit does not have PSU P4 connector which would be a power for the hard drives and the DVD drive. Instead there is a Backplane Connector (BP) which can't be used at the time.My question: is there any conversion from BP to PSU P4 that I can use? Any ideas? What would be my best options in this situation?Thanks! ",doc_456

It will make slots A3,A6 - B3,B6 unusable.But this LINK tells me that is OK to mix memory and third channel can be used. Look at the last picture. They have mixed 4 and 2 gb and the texts don't mention anything about the above statement.So the question is, is possible  to make the total ram equal each other of the R610.

"Hello, There are three Dell R520 servers need to update firmware, BIOS, iDRAC and other similar devices. All the details including service tags are in the table attached. Prior to upgrade any hardware components (f.ex. install new CPU and memory modules), all those units should be updated. And so we need a plan for this update. Asked for such a plan (for BIOS and iDRAC7 only) earlier, we have been kindly provided with one, but unfortunately didn’t fulfill it due to some reasons out of technical scope. Now the topic with that plan couldn’t be located. So would you please help us to build a proper plan for those servers update, including all the necessary subsystems? Thanks a lot!P.S. the table is removed by the author",doc_497
"Hello, We bought a Dell PowerEdge R630 with a dual E5 Xeon CPU inside. When we boot up the system for the first time we encoutered the error ""HWC2005 The system board Riser cable or interconnect is not connected, or is improperly connected."" After searching for hours on the internet and Dell Forums we think that this server is configured with a non dual CPU supported riser 1. When we take out riser 1 and let riser 3 inside the system, the server will acually boot up without any error. As soon as we get riser 1 inside the server the error showed up again. My question is which part number for the riser 1 is supported for a dual CPU? Thanks for any response!",doc_498

So I purchased 8 x 4gb (2Rx4 PC3-10600R-9-10-E1) ram. This is based on both Dells manuals and crucials webpage as to what this server would accept. When trying to install this ram these are scenarios and what comes up:1) Add the 8 new modules to the empty ""Black"" slots. The machine won't boot at all just buzzes.2) Take the 8 old modules out of the ""White"" slots and REPLACE with the 8 new modules. It boots but says ""Warning: The installed memory configuration is not optimal"".  Yet the bios reads 32gb of ram.3) Take it down to only 4 modules (new modules).

Hello. I have a PE T130 (2016) which now won't boot up completely. I have no video output and the NICs are not working either so I have no way of diagnosing the boot process and where the failure is. The hard drives apparently work fine. It powers on and the LEDs all show as normal - no failure messages through the LEDs. However the board is definitely not giving any output through the video card or the NICs.What is the procedure in this scenario for diagnosing the failure (motherboard or other components that may be causing the problem)? Because neither the NICS or the video card output a signal I am guessing it is the motherboard but please advise if not.Other questions. Are new motherboards available for this model? What other components that may be causing the boot error are available? Depending on the answer to this I will decide whether to spend time on diagnosing. How on earth do you order them and find out the pricing? Impossible to find a channel for buying parts even with the service tag.,doc_505

"Hello.  I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with the PowerEdge 840 that the company I work for has had for the past 14 years.  It has served the company well without issues but right before Christmas it died.  It would keep rebooting and never boot to the OS.  I turned it off, waited and turned back on and would get stuck at ""Strike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility"".  I like learning about computers so I volunteered to try and figure out what's wrong (doing so on my own time).  The company ordered a new server and is currently working off a backup.  The company doesn't have an IT person and from my understanding someone came to set up the server and that was it.  I don't know much about servers but would like to learn about them by trying to fix them.  Would greatly appreciate any insight on what's going wrong with this computer, and your time reading my description and questions.  Here's what's going on:When it is just plugged in (not powered on) the green and amber light would alternatingly flash.When it is booting up, Green light would stay on and Amber light would flashI took off the front panel and noticed that while it is booting, the C & D indicator light is amber.  A & B are greenWhile going through the POST process I would see the following:Foreign configuration(s) found on adapter.  Press any key to continue, or 'C' to load the configuration utility1 Logical Drive(s) found on the host adapter.1 Logical Drive(s) Failed1 Logical Drive(s) handled by BIOSIPMI Server Management Configuration Utility 1.5Baseboard Management Controller Revision 1.83Press <Ctrl-E> for BMC Setup within 5 sec.... - Nothing happens when I press Ctrl-EStrike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility. - By pressing F1, it just reboots.  When I press F2 I get into BIOS.When I press F2, the IDE Primary Drive 1 is an Unknown Device - Is that because I have a RAID controller? All SATA ports are OffAfter I get into BIOS, on the front panel lights A, B, and C are green, but D would sometimes turn green and sometimes remain amber.  The main amber light is still flashing.  The user's manual for the 840 says an amber D light means that it's an ""other failure"" which does shed too much light on what's going on.If I do a warm reboot by pressing ctrl-alt-del and get into the RAID configuration utility by pressing ctrl+R, the C and D light on the front remains amber, but I'm able to get into the Raid controller utility and see the virtual disk management.  If the amber C & D lights indicate a possible expansion card failure, how would I still be able to get into the RAID controller utility?When I get into the Virtual Disk Management Utility, I see the following:   Which indicates that drives 1 & 4 are bad because they are missing event though they are connected to the cable that connects to the RAID Controller and the virtual disk 0 is in red.Does that mean that since there's a problem with the drives 1 and 4, that all data is now lost?Here are the other pics from the menus.At this point, I don't know what to do.  I don't know much about RAID other than the data is spread through the drives.  I've been reading up on it and supposedly I can remove the bad drive and rebuild the RAID through import, but would it work with 2 drives? I posted in General Hardware because I wanted to make sure my hardware was good before I try and tackle RAID rebuild.Thanks in advance for ANY assistance that can be provided!",doc_520

"Here's the background:Stupidly, a former colleague setup a CRM system on what was meant to be an old development server that had long since been retired from frontline service but somehow between him and one of our developers, this became a ""live"" server with real data being added to a virtual machine (it's running a VSphere hypervisor) . Sure enough the PowerEdge 2970 in question has just died (all sorts of voltage regulator error codes for the CPU 1 side of things) and as you can probably guess, no backups since he created this a year ago.I had a look at it today and tried a couple of the suggestions I found on here associated with the error codes but without any luck, so I guess it's probably the mainboard itself.We do have a couple of other retired but still working (at least, still booting) 2970's in the server room that I might be able to cannibalise to get this one running again for long enough to copy the virtual machine off. However, they're not exactly the same spec. Processor wise and memory wise they're a match but the problem machine has a PERC6i controller with six disks (and I've no idea what the current configuration of those disks are other than a note I found that indicates 2 disks are used for the hypervisor and the other 4 disks are used for the virtual machines) and the other 2 PE2970's have a PERC5 and no disks at all.I'm pretty sure just simply moving the disks across would be a bad idea and possibly risk the data on them. Do you think swapping the PERC6i and the disks across to one of these spares would work? Would the PERC6 retain the disk configuration as setup on the original server when powered up in the ""new"" server?Alternatively, there's the option of swapping the mainboard across from one of the working servers, though I'm not sure if there will be any BIOS issues with it suddenly finding a different PERC controller attached to it.Any suggestions or pointers would be appreciated? As you can probably tell, I'm far from an engineer or server admin for that matter. Just need to get the thing up and running for long enough to clone the virtual machine onto something a little more suitable (and warrantied).Thanks in advance.",doc_552
"Heres a great one for you guys..I have TWO M520s configured identically that exhibit this problem.  Approximately every 1-2 weeks, they will slow down to about 5% of their normal speed -- as measured with some cpu benchmarking tools.I've killed the network connection to them to limit any outside interference.. and rebooted (warm boot).  The problem still exists.  I've even tried to warm boot and boot using PXE (to eliminate the OS completely from the problem).  I run memtest86+ v5.0.1  and you can see the speed problem while doing a memory test..  horribly slow.The only thing that will ""fix"" the issue is if I cold boot the server (power switch or via the drac works fine).  Then the servers are good to go for another 1-2 weeks before randomly slowing down again.The hardware is a M520, single E5-2420, dimms in DIMMA_2 & 3 (16gb 1333mhz dual-rank), H710 raid, and no mezz cards.  BIOS is 2.1.4.Things I've tried: switching from memory-mirroring to multi-bit ECC mode, upgrading RAID card (was H310) and fw,  upgrading NIC firmware, upgrading iDRAC fw (now on 1.57.57), upgrading LC fw.I don't believe I had this issue when I was on v1 of the BIOS.  I believe it is a firmware bug involving CPU throttling.",doc_553

"Hey all, might be a dumb question but the story behind it is that there is a SMB owner that isn't exactly in a spot to drop the $$ for a brand new server (at least yet, I am trying to buy them time) and their T610 has been rebooting randomly and it is exacerbated by the inability to communicate with the BMC which the POST erroneously states that it cannot find the iDRAC and reboots once to search for it again before it even hits the OS so we are looking at 20-30 minutes when the server is offline whenever it decides to reboot.  Windows Updates are set to ask so that the OS doesn't reboot to apply updates and the CPU, RAM, and HDDs show no error yet half the items within OpenManage are missing and ""System Services Disabled"" at POST does not allow preboot diagnostics and the Windows based diagnostics package complains about the LCL so I cannot find out any more information.  The EV logs just show a general hardware fault which Googlefu fails to turn up anything concrete.  I am pretty sure the motherboard needs replacement but my boss really hates the idea of throwing in a used part so I am trying to gather more clues.So my question is, if we were to install a DRAC Express module, would it stop complaining about the iDRAC (BMC) and let us use the ESM or is the DRAC dependent on the BMC?  Further, I've only been able to find a video for the DRAC in an R710 and the board naturally has a different layout and I am trying to figure out what the black rectangle does in the following picture:This looks like the DRAC Express but does not feel removable.  Can the BMC itself be replaced?  Should I just keep pushing for a motherboard?Thanks for any input!!",doc_556

"Hey all,So I've seen this happen on two separate R610s now in the last 2 days. We recently received 2 R610s back that was on loan to a vendor for the last 2 or so years. Before bringing it back into the pool, I plopped in a CD generated from Repository Manager that has the Linux Deployment Media on it in the first server. We've used this CD before on the other 20 R610s I support without issue. However upon rebooting, the BIOS which was supposed to be upgraded from version 2.2.10 to 6.3.0, has the BIOS Revision set to ""blank"". Yes. The POST screen says ""Bios Revision"" instead of ""Bios Revision 6.3.0"". After installing CentOS and attempting to re-run the Bios Update BIN file it says that the installed version is nothing.Yeah. Not good. And because of this I can't access the System Services / USC / LifeCycle Controller. It just hangs there. Everything else updated fine (iDRAC, LifeCycle, drives, raid, network, etc). So I thought... try 2. Install OS first (CentOS) and run patches from root when install is finished. Same deal and same issue. Everything else patched fine except the BIOS. I have tried:- Forcing a downgrade to 2.2.10 and 3.0.0 but both fail (even with the -f -q flags)- Re-flashing it and the LifeCycle controller- Attempted to run the Lifecycle repair package via the iDRAC interface (update the .usc file and have it run...)The system itself is operable, but I have no idea what impact this could have long term. ",doc_558

"Hey guys,I have a Poweredge R240 and unfortunately, one day, the fans randomly ramped up to 100% speed and never went back down. I also noticed a dialog that stated ""Ubuntu noticed a problem with a fwupd."" A couple of dialogs came up that said there were some problems. These seem to be software or firmware related. I attempted to set the fan control to low from IDRAC settings to no aveil. My next idea was to run the hardware diagnostics tool, I expected it to be like the Windows troubleshooter, but to my surprise it actually found some problems with the fans! I believe it might be a faulty temperature sensor causing the issue because I used lmsensors to get some temps, and everything was normal (32-34C). I attempted to disconnect the problem fan, but the fan speed stayed on 100%. I opened the case to see all 3 fans operating at 100% properly. From the pictures below, you can see that the server believes that the fans in slot 1 and 2 are not connected, but they are connected and running at 100% speed, it seems that it only detects fan 3.My question is: is there a temperature sensor embedded in the fan or is it seperate?

I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced a hole burned through their backboard under the heat sink? (see image) We unfortunately only have this one image of the under side of the backboard which would sit against where the drives were inserted, but you can still see the damage. This may be a dumb question, but how is the Heat sink normally attached to the back board? is it soldered on or held on by a screw(s)? We are basically seeking any advice/recommendations anyone may know as to how this may have happened (i.e. electrical surge, bad install/improper build, too hot environment, degraded UPS backup battery, etc.) or if anyone has any experience with something similar. ",doc_578

"Hi All,I currently have two Dell Power Edge R720 servers. Both servers have redundant 1100W AC power supplies. Two weeks ago a power outage caused one power supply of each server to malfunction which were replaced under warranty by new power supplies. Since then the PS2 socket of both servers have been reporting an error, VLT0204 System board PS2 PG Fail voltage is outside of range. Contact support.In order to solve the problem I powered off the system and disconnected the power cords and pressed the power button. I then swapped the power supplies re-connected the power cords and powered on the system. I repeated this step for the second server. Both the systems now did not report the VLT0204 error. However, the 'VLT0204 System board PS2 PG Fail voltage is outside of range. Contact support.' error message appeared on the front panel again. Repeating the steps above did not resolve the issue. I realised that this time the VLT0204 error became persistent. Just to be sure that the error is persistent I cleared the hardware logs after which I can still see a critical error in the iDRAC Server Health -> Voltages section.I used the DSET to generate the server report logs which too shows the VLT0204 error message. I can provide the entire zip file if needed.Should I ignore this error message or should I send it to Dell for inspection under warranty. Many Thanks Sohaib",doc_584

"Hi All,I have searched high and low for a reference to this interesting situation to no avail.  I have a EMC T440 that originally came with  a single Xeon Silver 4110 CPU.  I have since added a second processor - primarily to gain access to the single PCIe x16 slot tied to CPU2.  The processor is functioning just as expected and has even passed every stress-test I have thrown at it.While investigating an issue where installation of a GPU in that aforementioned x16 slot is triggering the chassis fan to ramp up to high-speed unnecessarily, I ventured into iDRAC (I don't really use it that much otherwise).  It is here where the second CPU is detailed (Cores, L1/L2/L3 cache, etc), but indicated to be ""Absent"" - while CPU1 shows ""Presence Detected"".Normally, I would just dismiss this since the CPU is functioning as it should where it matters.  But since I am unable to adjust the thermal profile for that slot with the GPU in it, I am starting to wonder if iDRAC's incorrect marking of the presence of the CPU is also leading to issues with the PCIe slot linked to it - and subsequently leading to the issues with setting LFM with the GPU present.  It should be noted, the GPU, a not-officially-supported BUT Dell-branded Radeon is also not detected in iDRAC either.  Since the lone PCIe x16 slot is linked to CPU2, I am starting to think these issues may be related.CPU2 shows ""Absent""BUT, it details the specs of an ""Absent"" CPU.  But CPU2 is certainly here - 2 x 16 Threads (8 Physical Cores) = 32.So, any ideas on why iDRAC does't think CPU2 is socketed (but can detail its specs)?  Is there some contact on the socket perhaps that triggers iDRAC's detection of the CPU's presence?  I DID have to slightly modify the heatsink module bracket to get the CPU to socket properly.  And while the CPU if functioning properly, is there some contact switch down there that this modification is failing to trigger perhaps?",doc_588

"Hi All,I recently inherited two R710's with the same specs. Both were quite behind on their BIOS and firmware updates (one was using 2.2.x the other 3.0.0) so I thought I would be a good idea to bring them up-to-date.Using the Centos boot disk I flashed them both with the latest 6.4.0 BIOS BIN file. Both seemed to update fine, but following the update the server that was previously on BIOS ver 3.0.0 is now not showing any BIOS version at all!!By that I mean that during POST the Dell screen says 'BIOS Version' and then nothing. Also if I go into the BIOS menu, no version is reported. Nor is it reported in any of the Dell utils / iDRAC.The same server is also exhibiting some other BIOS related weirdness:- it will no longer go into the F10 LC menu - it just freezes while loading.- Sometimes the Dell BIOS boot splash screen is corrupted. All I see is a blue gradient that starts half way down the screen.- In VMware ESXi VCenter the server Make/Model is not reported.I tried to rectify these issues by clearing the CMOS - no joy. Flashing the 6.4.0 BIOS again - nope. I also upgraded all other firmware (RAID, iDRAC, NIC...etc) - no joy here either.Finally I came across the Lifecycle Controller Repair Package. I flashed this using iDRAC and rebooted, It did nothing at all!!So now I'm stuck. The system boots fine and will load an OS, but I'm feeling very uneasy about putting it into production. I've considered trying to flash BIOS 3.0.0 back onto the server, but I have no idea if you can downgrade the BIOS and have been afraid to try as even the BIOS flash tool does not seem to know what BIOS version I am currently on.",doc_593

"Hi Everyone!So, I decided to go for linux mint 19.1 on a Dell r610. But, when every time, on the 3rd or 4th reboot, the system says, ""linux has crashed. You are now running in fallout mode.""  Linux does boot up until the 3rd or 4th reboot when it doesn't and gives me the crash note. I think the issue might be that the Dell R610 doesn't support Linux mint 19.1 but I don't know for sure.  I am new at Dell Servers and would like the answer as simple as possible. Also, Would Unbuntu Server Edition also work? Thanks  ",doc_620

"Hi Everyone,We have a M1000e chassis with 2 Brocade M6505 FC IOMs (B1/B2) and 9 working blades (M620/M630). The Brocades have 12 port licenses from which 1 is available. Brocades have DPOD mode enabled.The switchshow command shows active ports as 'N16 Online FC F-Port <HBA WWPN>' and the unused but licensed port 'In_Sync FC Disabled (Persistent)'.When we insert a new M630 blade with a dual port FC Qlogic QME2662 mezzanine HBA in slot B (fabric B), status of port 11 does not change and there is no connection indication on the Brocade, and the blade iDRAC shows the port 'down' and 'No Link'.  Note that the M630 has already OS installed (XenServer).We issue the ""portcfgpersistentenable 11"" command but we get: ""Port 11: portcfgpersistentenable failed. Configuration operation is not supported on internal (server blade) port.""The same blade was inserted to a slot of another already working blade and the switch detected it normally, showing the WWPN and the port going 'online' both on Brocade and in iDRAC. That eliminates any blade misconfiguration possibility. In this port portcfgpersistentdisable and portcfgpersistentenable commands are working normally. Note that when this slot is empty it shows as 'No_SigDet' and not as 'Disabled (Persistent)'.We included port 11 in the zoning configuration (forcibly aliasing the blade's WWPN) but no change in port status. Are we missing something here?

In the BIOS, I tried a few different settings with the TPM options but it makes no difference. The BIOS does, though, tell me that the TPM is active ??The prior Windows Server installation on this server didn't use the TPM so I have no idea if the TPM was ever working or if there even in fact is a TPM module in this server that has failed (how would I know if there is one anyway … did all T620's come with a TPM ?).This server is beyond warranty, and I don't think there's anyway to get a TPM replacement, other than replacing the entire motherboard …. so I may just go with Bitlocker with the USB drive option on startup....  ",doc_673

"Hi all,I'm a new-to-the-industry network technician assigned to an R620 server in a test environment. I am working on a PlanetLab project, and I'm trying to figure out how to bring this server online. I understand this sounds like a question for PL Support, but we've been stumped and at this point I'm trying to get any help or ideas I can try, in addition to working with PL Support.As part of the installation, I have a bootable CD with a custom Linux kernel. When booted from the CD, the server should initialize network connections then contact the PL central servers and install things. However, I never manage to get past the network initialization.The server has an Enterprise license. I assigned a public IP address to the iDRAC port, and nothing is connected to any of the ethernet port. It is on Dedicated mode. The iDRAC port is reachable remotely, and a test OS shows that I am able to make connections out from the server -- i.e none of the hardware is defective or misconfigured.The error I got was ""Device eth0 does not exist, most likely this CD does not support your hardware.""What I have tried so far:Adding a tag to tell the CD to look for em1 instead of eth0. I get the same message, ""Device em1 does not exist......""Adding a tag to tell the CD to look for the iDRAC MAC address.Changing the mode from Dedicated to Shared and selecting LOM1 as the active interface (with a working plugged in cable).Adding a tag to tell the CD to look for the MAC address of the LOM1 port.The error message remains the same. As a test, I tried using the CD to boot up on a few other Dell desktop computers (I didn't note the model numbers), and this time the CD recognizes eth0 on those machines (running Windows 7 Enterprise, though it shouldn't matter since the OS was not even booted up yet). So there is something about the way iDRAC vs NICs work. Beyond the basic understanding of the iDRAC being a separate controller with its own network adapter, processor, etc, I am new to the DRAC technology.Unfortunately, I cannot figure out what, and am running out of ideas. At this point, I'd appreciate greatly any ideas I can try to get the CD to recognize the DRAC network adapter. Or even one of the 4 ports. Thanks so much for reading.",doc_700

In the next few hours, I can access the KVM, launch console sessions, no issue.After a few hours time, when I try to launch a Java Session, it gives the error ""Could not connect to Server"". The error itself is pretty generic, and it is know from issues with Java, mainly due to security settings, like insecure/disabled ciphers , but his is not the case, Java Security settings are correct, the KVM is whitelisted, there are no proxies in between, no changes made on the client machine.KVM has the latest firmware, version  01.20.00 from dellkvm.com , we also  know from experience that if we re-flash the firmware, it also works during a few hours, the flashing process does some kind of reset...Steps already done/tried,  without success :a) Older Java Releases (it needs 1.7+ to work)b) Older Browsers (IE9, FF 45)c) Other OS (Windows XP,  CentOS) d) KVM standard rebootWe are running out of ideias here, does anybody have a clue ?

"Hi all,Recently I've been working on installing my Poweredge r610 server and I'm getting an error. I've been working on this for hours now but I can't figure out whats causing this.The error I'm getting says ""Fault detected in Drive 2"" (same error for drive 3). I've tried 2 different disks and also tried placing them in other slots. These drives are both very new and have pretty much not been used before placing them in the server. I've scanned them with a bunch of tools which both show no errors.When booting the server the orange flashing ligths become green. It also says it is loading all 3 virtual drives. My raid config utility shows no errors either. The drives are even detected by windows, useable and fast. While booting the lights start flashing orange again. I can still use them without any errors.Could anyone explain why I'm getting these errors? Thanks in advance!Please note that I am not a system administrator.

"Hi all,So I have a few R610s I want to upgrade the memory on. I read the documentation I found at support but I'm still slightly confused. They're all single processor (On the A side) with six 2GB DIMMS. (total of 12GB) I need to upgrade to 20-24GB. If I read things right, I can't use the B side since there's no processor.. What would be the best way to do this and is there some clearer documentation on how the memory banks/channels work? I read that it makes a difference where you install the DIMM (A1 A2 A3 etc..) but I couldn't figure it out past that. I also read that if you use all 6 on one side, it drops the bus speed to 800mhz.

It's not like it is a whooshing of air sound, its more of a churning engine sound (which I don't think is normal).Programs such as Speed fan and such do not work with this server, and I am sure I am using the program right since I use it on my desktop PC all the time when I feel I need a little bit more air flow.The BIOS doesn't seem to hold any answers to fan control and an external fan controller is near impossible to keep practical with this 1U.So I am thinking that I should lube up the fans, but I am not sure how to go about it :(I have lubed a fan before for a friend, but I knew a lot about the fan in question (A can of WD-40 and a steady hand was all it needed to get running quiet as a mouse). I am scared I mess up this fan because I have not got much experience with server fans. I will leave a link to a pic of the fan so you can see what it is.One method I have tried is to put socks under the corners of the server to dampen any vibrations, but that looks silly and only saved me 1 or 2 decibels (I use a decibel meter iPhone app).If you happen to know of any programs that can help me too, fire away. It is running Windows Server 2012 64-bit.Here is the picture:Thank you in advance.- Matty",doc_781
"Hi there!I have Dell PowerEdge R610 with 8*8GB RAM on board and decided to add more RAM recently, purchased  4*16GB and now, hosting support have no ideas how to make it 128GB They have tried different configurations of installing the memory into slots, and all memory sticks do not work together.

"Hi there,this is a question concerned with the first stepsusing iDRAC (in a special setup). I think I have to dig throughthe stuff but my hope is you can give me basic info to letme carry on a little bit more targeted….in a remote LAN we run a poweredge 730. The IT serviceconfigured an iDRAC with an internal IP. Parallelly we can access a root server within the same remote LAN. So logged into the iDRAC via sshand changed the password. Unfortunately wedon’t have access to their vpn. So my questions is what couldbe the best solution in order to access it:1.) let them configure an external IP  2.) on the shell I can see that the IDRAC interface opens 4 ports:     22/tcp   open  ssh     80/tcp   open  http      443/tcp  open  https     5900/tcp open  vnc     Could it be a more or less good solution to make a port forwarding e.g. with iptables     from that root server in the remote LAN in order to enable access to the iDRAC from remote ?   Sorry for this beginner questions. The main thing I’d like ask is how the client is look like, i.e. do we have a web based solution here or do I haveto download client program similar to the graphical client that let allows people to administer an ESXi Host.Looking forward to you answers.

"Hi, immediately after supposedly successful upgrade of R620 iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller from version 1.51.51 to 2.65.65.65 via web interface the web interface was normally accessible and displaying the new version; for example, the java-based console got new menu and former issues disappeared.

Since then, iDRAC web interface is no longer accessible. No relevant errors are reported in the Lifecycle Controller logs and correct versions if both iDRAC and LC are shown there.

"Hi,- T620 would get stuck on ""Configuring memory"" while booting. Never made it past that.- I then read about pressing ESC repeatedly while that message comes up and it actually worked.- Now my T620 would still show ""Configuring memory"" but after a minute it would say ""Configuring memory...Done"" and continue to boot.- It would now show a Memory Training Failure (RAM 1 and 3) while booting, but still boot. Only difference was that now I only had 48GB instead of 64GB, which made sense since my RAM is 8 x 8. - I was able to use the T620 just fine.- Installed a PCIe x 1 card into a PCIe x 16 (or is it x8?) slot and of course it would not work. The T620 would ""start"" but I would not see anything on the screen. I tried that twice and then took the PCIe x 1 card out again.- I switch RAM 1 with 2 and vice versa to see if the RAM is broken or the Motherboard.- Press the power button. Nothing. Took the power cable out, pressed for 10 seconds the power button, waited a minute, still nothing. The T620 makes no sound at all. ZERO. - Switched the RAM back the way it was, still nothing.- Checked the CMOS battery and it says 3 Volts, that it can't be that. I guess.At this point I have no idea why the T620 suddenly would not work anymore??? I heard no popping or smelled anything when plugging in the PCIe x 1 card because at the beginning I would that is what ""killed"" it.

"Hi,According to iDrac, the PowerEdge T440 I have is all well and fine. All components show a green tick.However, when querying with SNMP, the 'cooling' component reports status ""1"" (other).Background: We monitor all our servers and infrastructure using PRTG, which in this example uses SNMP directly to iDrac. The PRTG sensor is setup, but reporting result ""1"". The possible values for OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.5.4.200.10.1.44.1 areother(1), unknown(2), ok(3), nonCritical(4), critical(5), nonRecoverable(6)We have other Dell PowerEdge servers deployed (albeit none are T440's), and the monitoring in PRTG of these servers matches what we see in iDrac, so I can't work out why this discrepancy.The T440 BIOS is up to date. There is a single fan in the chassis, which is reporting as operational and I can view the fan RPM, which fluctuates slightly when I refresh the page. I have also confirmed locally that the fan is spinning.PS: The server resides in Hong Kong (purchased in HK) but is supported from the UK. I spoke with a UK technician who said they can only go by what iDrac is reported, but did offer to replace the fan regardless of it working correctly.Has anyone else seen an issue like this? I could ignore the monitoring of the fan, but this seems a likely component to fail, so would prefer to keep monitoring it.Thanks in advance.",doc_874

"Hi,Have a VRTX with 2 x M520 blades. It was previously used for 2 x ESXi hosts with shared VRTX storage, each M520 boots from SD cards.I now need to re-purpose this chassis and install Windows on one of the M520 blades and use the VRTX shared storage as backup.I have put 2 x 2.5"" HDD into one of the M520 with the hope of building a RAID1 volume and installing Windows to this and booting from it. There is a backplane in the M520 which has allowed the drives to plug in.VRTX - CMC firmware is on 3.40. IOMINF-1 is 11.0.0.0M520 - iDRAC firmware is 2.20.20.20 (41). CPLD version is 1.0.6. BIOS version is 2.4.2.When I connect to a M520 via the iDRAC virtual console, I see no way to access any internal / integrated controller and enable or disable it. This is the same from Lifecycle Controller and VRTX CMC.Dell Perc S110 configuration utility shows no physical disks so obviously virtual disk management is not possible. Lifecycle controller tells me S110 firmware is: 01/31/2012 18:28:47With SATA settings in BIOS set to RAID Mode, I get the following at startup (BIOS NOT INSTALLED - No Virtual Disks Found):However maybe these SATA controller 'RAID Mode' settings are nothing to do with the Perc S110?Is there something specific I need to do, or update, to allow me to see the physical 2.5"" HDDs and build a bootable RAID 1?Thanks.",doc_884

"Hi,I inherited through my business of a T310  that has no IDRAC6 Express or Enterprise card. The LCD panel remains blank/dark at all times (tried with a spare one, same result), and upon boot, it reports an IDRAC6 communication failure, which is normal since there is no card, then it reboots one more time before getting into Windows just fine. It never offers me to get into a BMC configuration utility. I tried to reset the BIOS settings to default to no avail. OMSA reports no issues. Also updated BIOS to latest version 1.8.2 with no changes. Fan is super noisy and I understand that by updating the BMC firmware I have a chance to fix that, but I just can't get into any BMC configuration.I believe there was an IDRAC6 card before, but it's not in anymore, so not sure how to clear that error. I have read that an IDRAC6 express card is OPTIONAL, so it shouldn't bother me about that.==> I want to clear these errors from POST, be able to upgrade BMC (or iDRAC) firmware so that I can get the fan to run at acceptable noise levels.1) How do I get the server to understand that there is NO IDRAC whatsoever, and to give me access to BMC configuration utility during POST ?2) Is it normal that the LCD panel remains blank at all times? Power button works fine, just none of the buttons works, never get any color/light. Is it possible that it is controlled by the IDRAC/BMC, which in its current mess, can't drive it ? I understand that the LCD panel comes with the hot-plug option (not sure why btw), so in my opinion, it should work independently of the IDRAC being there or not.I am ready to purchase an IDRAC6 Express card if there is a good chance that it will address this issue by eliminating the communication error and maybe give me access to the IDRAC config.But I would really like to understand what's happening before spending any more money on this.Thanks!  Max",doc_927

"Hi,I'm running into an issue on the PE R620 and hopefully someone can provide an answer here. I installed Windows 2012 R2 on R620 and when I was doing the Windows Update I noticed that it is really slow. After looking at the throughput, I noticed that the it is downloading at 20 kbps and that did not make any sense. So I unplugged the Ethernet cable from NIC1 and connected to NIC2. Of course, the download process started at normal speed. I then plugged the Ethernet cable back to NIC1 and visit Dell website to download a firmware and I noticed that it was behaving the same. Next, I decided to update both the Windows driver and the board firmware to the latest version (available on Dell). The update was successful but that did not resolve the issue. Also, Bios, Lifecycle controller and RAID controller were all updated to the latest version.I then run Dell pre-boot system assessment and every single test passed. With that, I decided to order a new Intel I350. Got the board today, installed it and it is behaving the same. I re-installed the OS.. still the same thing.

(already done, we're waiting)2: Order the spare parts and try to solve the problem on our own?I've to admit that ""Dell Cares PRO"" at last responded very fast to our problem, but since our Business is situated in Italy, we've to work with the ""Italian DELL customer Care Service"".The Italian Dell Reseller have no problem to re-pack the server and sent it back to Dell.But we have tried about 10 times on Friday to contact by phone the DELL Customer Care in Milan but we had no luck.Sorry for my bad English.And thank you all for reading. :emotion-5:Interior Designer at VPMaxwell Render & Archicad pro User.VR modelling & sculpting.",doc_1023

"Hi.  Had performance issues on the 5 year old PowerEdge T320 Server that turned out to be a Windows Hyper-V Issue.  I solved that issue.  However, as part of the troubleshooting process I ran the Pre-Boot Dell Utilities.  All tests passed, but the Fan Test caused the Rear Fan to be stuck on high.  I don't have an IDRAC License.  I don't have a Service Agreement.  Our plan was to retire the Server later this year, so I am trying to avoid purchasing a Service Agreement and/or IDRAC License.  I asked my Dell Account Manager if they could sell me something on the cheap since the issue was caused by running the Dell Diagnostics Tool, but the answer came back no.I have not updated the BIOS or the IDRAC Software or any other Dell Utility Software.  Perhaps that will help and I can do that for free.  Does anyone have any experience with this issue and if so, is it possible to fix without access the IDRAC Utility?  Also, I tried installing SpeedFan, but it did not recognize the server chipset.  SpeedFan detected the fan speed, but attempts to control the fan speed failed.  Is there a way to get SpeedFan or anther utility to work to lower the Fan Speed?Any other suggestions would be welcome.Peter at Cebic Technologies",doc_1071

This happens for a few seconds and at no particular interval but let’s say once every one to two hours.Here is what we noticed;On member server the RWW connection will break for a few seconds and then restored.However we also get MS Access database crashes which complains that network connection was lost and to restart db to continue. The MS Access database was running from a shared folder on the DC. We moved the db to a shared folder on the member server but MS Access database still crashed.We moved both DC and member servers to a different switch. No luck. We reinstalled Windows Server 2016 standard on DC and moved back MS Access database to a shared folder on DC but still no luck and MS Access database still crashes.Could all this be due to DC hardware networking issues such as faulty network card or network cabling connecting DC to switch? At this point I am considering changing both DC’s network card and cable.Is there something someone can suggest to home in on this issue?ThanksRegards,doc_1091

"I am in the process of learning how to configure a barebones PowerEdge R930 server.Now that memory and processors are installed and working with the latest bios and firmware, I have begun to focus on the task of adding hard drives.I have puchased a used Seagate ST91000640NS hdd and it is now installed on backplane at BayID 3, as device 0, with cable connection to PERC H730p Adapter. No other drives are currently installed. No operating system has yet been installed. The hdd has a SATA interface, with a 2.5 inch form factor, a capacity of 1T and it is an enterprise-quality hdd.I have observed a rapid flashing orange light for several minutes when the system first boots. After a few more minutes have passed, there is no longer an orange light flashing but instead there is a rapidly flashing green light.Should I take this as normal behavior?I have looked at LED light explanations online which seem to suggest that flashing green may indicate ""rebuilding"" or a drive that has not yet been detected. I am not sure how long I should wait for the status of the LED to change before taking additional actions.For example, I am not sure if I should replace the hdd immediately, or take another alternative action. Among possible alternative actions, I am not sure if I should upgrade the firmware for the hdd, or if I should wait until after an operating system has been installed, or if I should wait until after the H730p has had a driver and firmware update.If anyone can offer a common-sense suggestion, please know that your comments will be greatly appreciated.An ebay vendor stated that the ST91000640NS is compatible with R930, but I have now realized that no firmware seems to be available for this specific hdd when I search with my service tag from the R930 driver search page here on the Dell website. Besides firmware support, is there any other way to determine hdd compatibility between ST91000640NS and R930 server?Thank you to all in advance.  ",doc_1126

"I am testing for disaster recovery for our T610 server. I have a second similar T610 server and using the SBS 2011 media and a Windows Server BMR backup from the production server attempted to restore to the ""testing"" server. Both have the same PERC Raid cards and I configured the second server to contain the same RAID 1 (os) and RAID 5 (Data) Virtual drives. I have gone thru the recovery process a few times. First I did it without installing any drivers and after restoring (and before rebooting) the system came up with the drive letters incorrect (system reserved was C: and the OS and Data drives were something like D: and E:). Before rebooting the restored computer I used diskpart to reassign drive letters (removing the drive letter from system reserved and assigning it as active in the process).  When I booted the system after removing the DVD it would only allow me to go into the repair mode (""start normally"" fails). Also, once in repair mode the drives are back to what they were before i changed them. I can change them again, but when I reboot they change back again, same scenario.  So, for the next try, I used the same procedure, but in addition to above, i added the PERC drivers during the process.  The behavior was the same except in this case the system reserved drive showed up in diskpart without a drive letter. But, after changing the other drive letters and rebooting, system reserved now has C; and the other drives have once again reverted to ""incorrect"" drive letters. And I still have a none restored system.  Each restore attempt take several hours due to the amount of data, so any guidance is greatly appreciated.Also, I did a check of the Production server and believe both systems are using BIOS rather than EUFI.Sincerely,Patrick",doc_1138

I have a T410 which I bought to use as a homelab/home server.It had very old firmware and I have managed to upgrade the important things to the latest versions: BIOS/iDRAC/Lifecycle Controller (and a couple of other things).Before I started upgrading I was able to do hardware diagnostics from the UCS.As part of my upgrade process I tried installing the diagnostics package from this page:https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=2mm6jThe machine is still quite stripped down (no disks and only 4GB RAM). I was doing my installations from the Support Live Image (2.2). Some firmware I could install that way but the diagnostics installation failed with the following message:Update Failure: Partition Failure - Attach partition has failedI also got this message when trying to upgrade the Lifecycle Controller and I resolved that by installing the UCS package via iDRAC. If I'm not mistaken the installation attempt above messed up the System Services and I had to install the UCS package again.So right now I have working iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller but no built-in hardware diagnostics. I was considering leaving the machine without the diagnostics system. But I had intended to run the diagnostics before putting the computer into use. Will I be missing much?

"I have a T410 with I bought with a single E5504 processor and 2x2GB RAM.I would like to run it with 64GB so I bought four 16GB memory modules: Micron 16GB 2RX4 PC3L-12800R.According to the following document this should be supported, if configured for Optimizer mode in the BIOS.https://dl.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-t410_user's%...I have changed the BIOS setting (after I remembered it the first time booting failed with four modules) and I can boot the server with two of these installed (in A1 and A2) - the BIOS says that the RAM is running at 800MHz and I understand that to be a limitation of the CPU. But if I install all four modules, or even just three (in A1, A2, A3) the server appears not to boot - it sits at ""Configuring memory, please wait."" I haven't left it for hours to get past that, could it be that that's what I need to do?I'm wondering if this might also be a limitation of the processor. But the processor spec page seems to indicate that it supports three memory channels and much more than the 64GB I have.Some clarifications:I took out the modules which were in A1 and A2 and put in there the ones which were in A3 and A4. The machine still boots. So it does not seem that the issue is a faulty module.All firmware is at the latest version, to the best of my knowledge - with the exception of the BMC (BIOS is at 1.14).Does anyone have an idea what the issue might be?Thanks",doc_1267

"I have an R210 server that was built from a barebones chassis from eBay. The PS/Ram/CPU/MB were also bought on eBay. My question is this: IS there *any* other item from the above list that could cause the powerup diags 1 and 4 lamps to light? I know that the 1-4 combination indicates mainboard failure, but here's the thing. I've recieved two allegedly tested mainboards from the same eBay vendor that exhibited the same error on powerup. I returned those and bought another board from another non-eBay vendor and it exhibited the SAME error on powerup. I tried removing the ram and powering the system up, I got the expected ""1"" light indicating no ram present. I supported Dell servers in my job prior to retirement, but never really had to worry as we had onsite warrantee on all of our server systems. I find it hard to believe that 3 mainboards from two different vendors would exhibit the same failure/error code.. Hoping there is something else that is causing this error...ThanksDave",doc_1306

"I have eight M910 blade servers installed inside of an M1000E enclosure. I installed them, one by one, while systematically installing an operating system on each one. Now, I want to network them all together. However, for some reason, I can get no more than five of them to run, at the same time.Once the M1000E has been powered on, I start pressing the ""on"" buttons on each of the servers. I get a solid blue light for each of them, until I push the power button on the sixth server. When I push the power button on the sixth server, the power button blinks a few times, and then stops. If I try to turn it on, via the web-based CMC browser, I receive a message which states ""Another action is being performed on this server. Try again"".I can wait, for several minutes, and try again. However, I continue to get the same result. The power light blinks a few times, and then stops. However, if I turn off one of the running servers, and then try to turn on server six, server six starts up, with no problem. Then, when I try to turn on the other server, that I just turned off, it's power button blinks a few times, and won't turn on.This strange phenomenon seems to happen to any of the servers. It doesn't seem to matter which ones get turned off, or turned on. However, I can only get five of them to turn on, with no problem. Whenever I try to turn on a sixth, the power button just blinks a few times, and then stops. If I try to turn on a seventh one, the power button just blinks a few times, and then stops.Based on this behavior, I began to think that, perhaps, all of this is due to insufficient power from the power supplies. I'm using three 110v power supplies. However, each one is supposed to be capable of putting out 1350 watts. With five servers running, the M1000E shows that the entire system is only consuming about 1600 watts. So shouldn't the three power supplies be capable of providing enough power to power all eight blades?Each blade has 128 GB of RAM and four E7-4830 processors.I'll probably end up buying more 110v power supplies, and try running the M1000E with a total of six, instead of three. However, because each power supply can put out 1350 watts, and I have three of them, shouldn't that provide roughly 4050 watts of capability? If so, then why am I not able to turn on another server when power consumption is at 1600 watts?I should also note that, while looking at power configuration options, in the web-based CMC tool, I checked ""Server Performance Over Power Redundancy"". Shouldn't that ensure that these three power supplies are being used to their maximum potential?I look forward to hearing any suggestions that anyone may be willing to provide. I really need to be able to run all eight blades.  Thanks for your time.",doc_1328

Affected portgroup: vMotion-1. 1 uplinks up. Failed criteria: 128""This causes the current and any remaining vMotions to fail.  Worse, my vMotion and VM networks share nics, so every VM remaining on the source host drop off the network.The nics that fail are the 10 GB nics on the x520-k using driver ixgen 1.6.5.VMware has punted, telling me to contact Dell to check drivers and firmware.  The equipment is so old, support is no longer offered. I found a couple firmware updates for the x520-k. The most recent is compatible with 6.5.. so I applied the next most recent that works with 6.0 and it didn't help.Everything I've checked shows this equipment is supported on ESXi 6.0, and I have all the recommended firmware/driver versions.As a workaround, I discovered administratively cycling the nics fixes the problem (esxcli network nic down -n vmnicX, esxcli network nic up -n vmnicX).  I've also considered separating the vMotion and VM network nics but I have no good options there - either I lose back end switch redundancy for some things, or when the problem happens I take down management or iSCSi instead of the VM networks.  Going back to 5.5 is a terrible option as I'm trying to get us to vCenter 6.7, which doesn't support 5.5.   ",doc_1345

"I installed a brand new PowerEdge R340 server in early December. Over one month, it has rebooted five times for no apparent reason. The last time, yesterday, there was a very short power fluctuation which made one UPS beep; the server rebooted. So, the reboots appear to be power related.The server has redundant 550w power supplies, each connected in an APC XS1500 UPS. I don't understand how this setup could be this sensitive to a power fluctuation, unless both UPSs are fried.Also, I disconnected one power cable from one UPS to connect both power cables in the same UPS just a few minutes ago and the server rebooted.

I don't care about Dell supporting it but I am not allowed to use my $100 Graphics card from Best Buy?  I really hope I'm just missing something.  Can the T420 use graphics cards other than the Nvidia Q4000 or Q6000?  If not, does anyone know why?  Is this a bios enforced limitation?  Is it some other technical limitation?",doc_1424
"I recently had a 600GB 15K SAS drive go into predictive fail in a 4-drive RAID 5 array.  The server has the latest supported build of OMSA on the system, but the web interface is not working, so I am working with the command line, which I am much less familiar with.  I pulled the predictive-fail drive from the system and replaced it with a refurbished drive.  The drive is being recognized properly, but it was not added to the array.  Instead it appears to be treated as a stand-alone drive.  The pred-fail drive was 0:0:1, but for some reason 0:0:0 went into rebuild, not 0:0:1.  The rebuild completed, but the array is still showing only the 3 drives and shows a status of ""degraded"".My first though is to flag the new drive as a hot-spare (it is not seen as such) and hope it grabs it for the rebuild, or reboot the server and hope that corrects the issue, though that seems less likely to correct the issue, and more risky.  Has anyone else seen this?  Any suggestions would be appreciated!",doc_1425

Whether I use the H310 BIOS configuration utility or OMSA, it is always marked as ""foreign"", and I'm unable to utilise it in the array.I am unable to add it as a hot spare, or indeed do anything else with it. I'm beginning to think that I'll need to pull the original (still good) disk, and replace it with one identical to the ""new"" replacement I installed and completely reinstall the OS (which I'm obviously keen not to do). Is there any way I can ""force"" the controller to add the new disk to that RAID1 array, and thus have the array rebuilt?",doc_1478

"Our 'old' PER320 (rackmount) is ""severely over-taxed"" since it still has the 'stock' E5-2407 2.2GHz quad-core XEON processor installed.  As it stands right now, the owners are a tad reluctant to replace this server, so I need to 'upgrade' this bad boy as much as is possible (I know, I know... with ALL possible upgrades, this will cost nearly as much as an entirely new server - but I'm just the 'nerd' and it isn't always necessary to listen to what WE recommend...).   So I've been on the hunt for an ""affordable"" processor upgrade .. (at least for now until my 'reasoning' meets more receptive ears).  So - I know the PER320 normally supports E5-2400 series as this mainboard supports these 'out-of-the-box', and I've looked at E5-2440's (hexa-core) and E5-2470's (octal-core) and the prices aren't actually as bad as I might have originally estimated ($$$$), but I just stumbled across an E5-2470 V2 (which is a deca-core - nice! 10 cores and hyper-threading too..?) which SEEMS to have very similar specs as the E5-2470, and is being offered locally for what I think is a remarkably cheap cost (it's good to have friends in the 'refurb' and 'lease-return' business, no doubt..).  So, according to the supplier, this ""chip"" is ""tested and verified"" fully operational, having been removed from a 'damaged' rackmount server just this past week.  But is there something about this chip I'm not aware of as it might pertain to the PER320?  Or maybe something I'm just 'ignoring' in my drive to put some 'spunk' in this server..?  Or maybe I am simply dreaming that this might actually function in the R320..(?) Gotta do something... this server is just TOO slow and cranky...BTW: the RAM has been upgraded in the PER320 to 32 GB, and all the four of the hard disks have recently been replaced with larger, faster disks since they'd 'overrun' the previous storage space in just two years.  (but "".... buy a NEW server..?  Nah...  Didn't we just buy THIS one..?"")",doc_1638

Still nothing..  I got out a multimeter and check the female side on the power cord with a reading of 118v.  So I opened the case and peaked inside.. confirmed most of the cables and memory.  Tried again and still nothing.. So I gave up a bit and thought maybe it just needs to sit plugged in awhile.. Came back today and tried, hit the power button and until is still completely dead.. No light flashes, no fans..

Server would not power on. Dell tech came and replaced the backplane and PER620 card and then left. The server will now power on but will not boot the existing volume or virtual drive. The server is remote to us and I’m guessing and hoping it’s a simple configuration issue with the new controller but how did the Dell tech know if they didn't see it boot up? The folks on site said the POST does recognize the 1 virtual drive.  But it does not boot up.  They tried to boot using the BIOS and the UEFI options.Is it something simple like setting the  virtual drive as bootable? I thought that some controllers could read the config from the disks?I was hoping there was maybe a tech note on getting the system to boot after replacing the back plane and or PER620 controller.,doc_1685

"T320 with Xeon E5-1410 will throttle and get stuck at low speed.  Cold rebooting server will fix.  Random issue occurred on 2 servers now.   One was set in the bios to DAPC.  The other, Windows controlled (yes Windows power settings were set to Performance).  One had the latest bios (Server 2012 R2) and the other had an older bios (Server 2008 R2).   I stress tested the cpu on both and observed no overheating.This is a known bug with Dell PowerEdge T320 Servers with a Intel Xeon E5-1410 v2.  On the Server 2012 R2 server, it was happening randomly only once or twice a month.  On the Server 2008 R2 server it only happened a couple of times at random.  The CPU would go down to below 0.20 Ghz and the 2012 server would crawl and service availability was seriously degraded.   This also happened to another client T320 Server with Server 2008 R2 with an Intel Xeon E5-1410.  Multiplier would not increase from 12 and the server was running at ~1.2ghz.

I don't know yet, if there's a way to remotely power it up over the Internet on demand for data restores.Also, I don't know if the hard drives must spin all the time with a PERC controller... apparently yes.

So I accessed it via RAC and configured the BIOS for an external video card, a 1xPCIe, with no problems. Booted to a Win7 on an SSD and installed 5 or 6 different firmware upgrades via Dell Command 2.0. Since I need a working RAC I switched the BIOS video settings back to internal.  Well -, now I don’t have internal video nor does the RAC ping any more. I figured that the firmware reset the iDRAC’s  fixed IP to its default, so I also tried default 192.168.0.120. I also removed reset the BIOS via the on board jumper. The front panel reports the RAC IP as how I configured it before the firmware upgrades. I re-seated the iDRAC6 Enterprise adapter and the single CPU and all DIMMS.I have a second CPU and DIMMS and additional drives that I have not installed yet. And I just checked that the 3 year warranty ended December 2014.What am I missing? And thanks in advance for any help.Volker",doc_1750

"Twice now I have had the Exchange 2010 guest on my W2K8 Standard Server with Hyper-V suddenly suffer a massive amount of latency and become practically locked up out of the blue.  After hours of troubleshooting, rebooting, and researching - as a last-ditch effort I noticed that the BIOS was out of date.  I upgrade BIOS and then everything magically works again.Anywhere from 2-4 months pass and rinse & repeat. I'm going out on a limb here but I suspect that there's something about the system that gets flushed out during a bios update that is causing the problem, but I'm at a loss to determine what that is.  I want to proactively avoid having my customer's Exchange server fail, but it goes against my better judgment to apply BIOS updates proactively.  We've had the motherboard swapped out already due to a bad DRAC, and the problem keeps happening.I could use some help in identifying what else I can do to prevent this from happening in the future.  TIA",doc_1755

All of this is working fine with Ubuntu 14.04 installed on the host servers.Recently we purchased three more K20 GPU cards from Dell and fiited them alongside the existing two K20 cards.

After some experimentation I found that the kernel cannot allocate memory for the PCI-e BAR (base address registers) if more than 2 GPUs are installed - for the nVidia K20 cards lspci -vv reports things like:Region 0: Memory at c1000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)         Region 1: Memory at <ignored> (64-bit, prefetchable)        Region 3: Memory at <ignored> (64-bit, prefetchable)and there are lots of errors in dmesg like:[    0.573153] pci 0000:04:00.0: BAR 13: can't assign io (size 0xe000)[    0.573236] pci 0000:05:08.0: BAR 14: can't assign mem (size 0x200000)[    0.573320] pci 0000:05:08.0: BAR 15: can't assign mem pref (size 0x200000)The nVidia driver reports[   17.028050] NVRM: This PCI I/O region assigned to your NVIDIA device is invalid:[   17.028050] NVRM: BAR1 is 0M @ 0x0 (PCI:0000:14:00.0)[   17.028052] NVRM: The system BIOS may have misconfigured your GPU.[   17.028056] nvidia: probe of 0000:14:00.0 failed with error -1[   17.028241] NVRM: The NVIDIA probe routine failed for 1 device(s).[   17.028243] NVRM: None of the NVIDIA graphics adapters were initialized![   17.028244] [drm] Module unloaded[   17.028314] NVRM: NVIDIA init module failed!The BIOS on the C6100 blade was version 1.66 and I have updated this to the latest 1.71 version but the problem remains.There is another interesting thing: the original K20 GPU cards we bought last year have serial nos ending in 0009 and 0010 - the new ones we have just received have serial nos 0012, 0058 and 0064. Now, the card with serial # 0012 works on it's own or with either of the existing cards fitted but cards 0058 and 0064 do not work even it fitted on their own - we are seeing the same error messages reported by dmesg and lspci as we get when fitting more than 2 GPU cards. I'm guessing these are later K20 cards that are different from the earlier ones?It seems there is a limit to the number of K20s that can be used with the C6100 and/or compatibility issues with later cards.

"We have a Dell PowerEdge FC630 server that is not wanting to cooperate. It houses a VMWare ESXi Host. Last week, the host migrated all of the VMs to other Hosts, and was inaccessible within VSphere. We rebooted the blade in hope that would correct the issue. The issue we are now facing is that during the boot process, the server is asking for a password. After much reading and researching, I think this to be a setup password of some kind. Unfortunately, this server was configured well before my time and I apparently do not have this password. I've tried many, many different ones I thought it could be to no avail. Default passwords included (calvin). Here is the screenshot of where the iDrac Virtual Console is asking for the password:I have read in the manual that a password can be removed by moving the jumper on the system board from pins 1 and 2 to 2 and 3, although I am unsure if this will reset that password in the screenshot. I tried this, but after putting the sled back in the chassis and booting it, the server never fully booted back up. I waited probably 10-15 minutes for the power button to stop flashing green before powering it off, moving the jumper back to the original pins, and booting it. The server did power back on and I was able to get to the iDrac again, but it still prompting for this password.We are working on gaining support for the server blade, but until then, I figured I would see if anyone had more information that could be useful to this issue.Last resort would be to reset the blade and reinstall the VMWare Host, but we are really trying to keep from having to do that.Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas or recommendations!",doc_1786

Talk about a chicken and an egg: console which is disabled would be enabled by the hard reset, but to complete the reset you would need the console. Argh.We cannot log on to iDRAC remote console as we do not have the root password, which also keeps us from running DRAC tools remotely. We could run racadm locally without credentials, but that would require a local OS installation in the server, which we do not have.What we need is a hard, hard reset of iDRAC without local console or iDRAC root.

But strange thing is that Out of 16 drive each one of them shows 'Ready' status as I plug them. But as soon as I configure them to build raid0 each of one them converts into 'failed'.

The PM9A3 disks fit into the caddies fine and you can insert the disks most of the way into the (U.2) bays but they don't connect to the interfaces when in the DXD9H caddies because the connectors are not aligned correctly by a few mm.

We recently purchased an R900. I tried to use 2 western digital black 1TB hard drives set up in a RAID1The array was successfully created and was seen as Optimal. But after a short period of time I get a an HDD fault on that array (both drives blinking amber). I bought  a new WD Black 1TB drive thinking that I might have a bad drive. I attempted to create a new array with the new drive and got the same error but again the RAID controller saw no problem with the array(but still two blinking amber lights). I was beginning to think that my PERC 6i card might be bad. As a test I wiped one of my new WD 1TB Black drives inserted jut that drive in the box and booted up. It was green for the first minute or so after boot and then it began blinking amber with a HDD error again. I tried the other 3 of my WD 1TB drives one by one with the same result. Lastly I found an older 120GB WD drive and tried that drive. This time there was no HDD Error message and the light has remained green. I doubt that I have 4 bad WD 1TB Black Drives.

"When reading the Dell EMC NetWorker VMware Integration Guide I got to this part:Number of virtual proxies per ESX host depends only on the type of hardware onwhich the ESX has been installed.For lower-end ESX hosts, it is recommended not to mix I/O load on ESX (with thevirtual proxy and VMs residing on a single ESX), but to have a separate ESX forthe virtual proxy.For high-end ESX hosts, it is recommended to have a maximum of 5 virtual proxiesconcurrently running on a single ESX host.But I couldn't figure out if I should consider my hosts lower-end or high-end for that matter. The host in question is configured like this:Model: PowerEdge M630Processor Type: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHzLogical Processors: 56Memory: 256GBNICs: 4I think it might be relevant because we have what I consider a small environment (65 VMs) and every week we have to backup many VMs manually cause the vproxy/Networker routine failed.",doc_1841
