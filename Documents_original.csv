"As you know, the BIOS on your PE T100 does not allow your to disable the integrated ATI ES1000 video controller which means you will run into all sorts of issues. And no doubt you have seen the many posts on such topics with the many hit/miss outcomes. In another posts you asked about removing the management card (which in some systems is a pci card laid flat on the motherboard and contains the ES1000 graphics amongst other functions). But there is no mention of such a card on the T100 hardware owners manual so it doesn't seem to have one to remove.And the odd thing in the HOM is that on page 106 we see,""Trouble Shooting Video Subsystem,Action 2. Determine whether the system has an expansion card with a video output connector. In this system configuration, the monitor cable should normally be connected to the connector on the expansion card, not the system's integrated video connector. To verify that the monitor is connected to the correct video connector, turn off the system and wait for 1 minute, then connect the monitor to the other video connector and turn the system on again"".Hardly a statement that clarifies much! I would expect that if the BIOS actually does not allow one to disable the integrated video, then there should be a clear statement that video expansion cards are not supported and that the system's integrated video connector should always be used. My only suggestion is to try the NVS300 in the x8 PCIe slot and if that fails, try a cheap ATI based x16 PCIe consumer card of similar vintage to the ES1000 (but this would require cutting a slot on the card's connector to allow it to fit into the x8 slot). Again this may still have conflicts and fail to work so it's a suck it and see approach. A second hand ATI x16 PCIe card can be had for very little outlay (but always test it works in a desktop PC before your start to hack away). View solution in original post",doc_23,23

"The fact that the .pdf you linked to is buried several layers deep on the Dell website only solidifies my argument that it shouldn't take this much effort to find valid information such as that.Furthermore, the 1.12.0 BIOS update simply states further support for more 5600 ""SERIES"" processors. The specsheet.pdf for the server states 5600 ""SERIES"" both of which are more easy to locate than the .pdf you linked to (i.e. Google Poweredge t410)The technicalguide.pdf you linked to only solidifies my sentiment that Dell needs to be more clear about their documentation. Example 6.1 Overview (table 8) The Poweredge t410 provides support for up to two processors. It then lists 95 watt and 130 watt. Furthermore it gives reference to a set of supported processors but only goes up to the X5650. It gives no reference of what BIOS version was used during testing, however the date-stamp on the .pdf indicates July of 2011 but the newest BIOS version is from 2013. I hope with these examples you will be able to see that simply ""assuming"" things as ""good indicators"" can trip-up the most seasoned Sys Admins.And FWIW the X5675's are the fastest highest watt TDP processors that can run in the T410.

"Thanks DerikC :)After experiencing this problem on another Dell system with a different Seagate update it appears to be related to systems with Exchange installed on SBS (Small Business Server) systems.Taking your I/O comments on board I shut down all services (including Exchange and SQL) and verified from performance monitors that the disks were idle. However the update still failed (on both systems).I then scheduled the update for a regular patch round, and applied immediately after reboot. It then worked fine on both systems.Strange given that the I/O on startup was very high as services are starting and the Exchange store is mounting, but the update still completes OK.Therefore to assist anyone experiencing this issue, it is definitely recommended to take the advice of applying immediately after a restart of the server (regardless of I/O).The invalid image file error message is misleading, as it implies there is something wrong with the update itself, corruption or otherwise. There does appear to be a correlation with the length of time the server has been running and the failure of the update, regardless of I/O, which a reboot fixes.Anyway, problem now solved!

Some systems are longer-lived in the marketing phase than others. For example, when the 12G systems began sales, you could purchase an R510 or an R520 for only a few short weeks before the R510 disappeared. The R410 and R420 were sold simultaneously for quite a while before the R410 disappeared from Dell's site. Just assume that once a new generation is ANNOUNCED that the life of the model being replaced could end very soon."" We are still selling 14Gen R340 even though 15Gen R450, for example, are currently selling also.https://dell.to/3Ep4ust Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"UPDATE/RESOLUTIONTurns out all the SFP's were fine — there apparently was some issue with negotiation with the switch on the build bench.To troubleshoot, I had a DAC cable and plugged that in between sleds.  Lit right up.  So then I plugged the sleds into each other and all the SFP's for base-T, even non-Dell, worked fine talking to each other.   Then tried another switch and the SFP's lit right up.In my research on this problem, I had heard about some of these SFP's needing to be manually set to a speed to be backwards compatible with some switches, but in places such as iDRAC configuration, the link speed configuration options are dimmed…. probably because iDRAC is sharing those NIC's so it can't/shoudn't override the system configuration.  I don't see another place to configure this, however.I hope that in newer Dell software that (1) the presence of SFP's is better communicated, and (2) the status of a present/inserted LOM/SFP could also be shown (such as no cable/network connection).View solution in original post",doc_76,76

"Hi Kimleng Vey,The error that you are receiving  “the iDRAC is not ready. The configuration values cannot be accessed” is a communication error with the iDRAC. Try to reset the iDRAC and see if it becomes responsive. On the R720 the easiest way to do this is to hold down the i button on the front of the server for more than 15 seconds, this will do a soft reboot of the iDRAC. If the iDRAC is still not responsive after you do this please power off the server and unplug it for about a minute, while it is unplugged hold the power button in for 10 seconds, this will drain any power from the system so that the iDRAC powers off fully.

And it may be that Dell has not done what's needed within UEFI firmware configuration for pcie graphics to even work... UEFI is outside my knowledge area...But one problem you will find is that when you install a non dell certified card, fans will go nuts but at least Dell has provided IMPI commands to disable such an aggressive fan responce.Below is comments pulled from post 6 which explains the issue and how to fix it on centos based systems.Similar is possible on Windows server OS though some components may need to be installed (links below).Good luck,...** Description: The default automatic cooling response on PowerEdge 13G server for third-party PCIe cards provisions airflow based on common industry card requirements.

"My question is, would this difference in CPU make such a big difference when it comes to fan speed?Yes, it can.The BMC and BIOS work together to control fan speeds. The BMC is programmed to run fan speeds within a certain threshold based on system configuration. A minimal configuration will have a low fan speed minimum, and will increase up and down with system temperature. A maximum configuration will have a higher minimum fan speed.I don't have access to the exact settings the BMC is programmed for, but different CPUs can change the minimum fan speed settings. You might want to try reflashing the BIOS and BMC/iDRAC, and also clear NVRAM to make sure there is nothing corrupted in memory. If you still encounter the same fan speeds then that is what the BMC/iDRAC is programmed for.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_171,171

"Okay, it might be a bit late and Paul @paul_1011 was pointing it out in an article he shared - but to keep a bit more information in this thread rather than on an additional outside ressource:The point is, that 12th gen Servers lack the NVMe drivers necessary to recognise a NVMe drive at BIOS/UEFI level. The drivers necessary for this awareness were AFAIK added only to the UEFI bioses of later gen models (iirc >= 13th generation).There is an NVMe Flash option available to the R720 line up, but it will not add boot support, as this option is built around a PCIe 3.0 x16 adapter (D P/N YPNRC ) that splits those 16 lanes into 4x4 lanes with each lane than being occupied by one NVMe flash drive. The drives are thus only presented via PCIe to the OS, but not to the BIOS/UEFI, as Daniel @DELL-Daniel My states here Dell R720 with PCIe SSD-Backplane and Extender Card but no drives showing .So in short: there is NO direct way of booting NVMe drives on 12th gen DELL servers. However, you can do a simple trick to boot an OS stored on NVMe - and that's what Paul linked in his post:Boot to an (internal) USB/internal SD-card on which a boot loader like Clover resides. Add NVMe drivers to that boot loader to make the OS stored on your NVMe drive (e.g. a M.2 NVMe SSD connected via an adaptor in the back) visible to Clover. Clover will then boot from that NVMe drive.Kind regards and stay safeYannikJust a student with too much interest in ITView solution in original post",doc_218,218

"Jpalmieri_HDS,The issue you are running into is that the R710 that you have has a customized BIOS, specifically created per the original customer. Now you can get the update to run and update the BIOS to the Dell standard, but you can't go back. So if there is software dependent on the custom BIOS, then you shouldn't update. If you are doing a clean OS install and such, then there shouldn't be an issue. I would recommend not going to the latest BIOS though, I would step it up. So I would start with this BIOS version, then walk up to the current. The process you will use is with the bootable USB, and non-packaged update. Boot to it as you did, but when you run the filename include /forcetype after it.For example R710-060100C.exe /forcetypeThat will force the update through, and after that you will be able to use the future BIOS updates from support.dell.com as they are released.Let me know how it goes, and if this helps.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

I don't believe that it could, but it's something worth double checking. Updating in-band won't be an option, because Debian isn't supported. If the LCC doesn't work with the SUU, then It think you would be best served by grabbing the Dell Support Live image, booting to that, and running individual firmware packages through there. The Support Live image is CentOS based and shouldn't get hung up on OS version scans. There is also the Repository Manager tool, which can be used to create your own bootable firmware update image, but there would be a fair amount of effort involved.

"HelloM393B2G70DB0-CMAYes, this is a validated memory module for the T620. We have it listed under several part numbers, 12C23 is one of the part numbers.M393B2G70QH0I was unable to locate this model number in our part database.if I have the 1st part number already used in my server, will I be able to use the 2nd one as well?The first module does not appear to be validated, so I can't say for sure it will work. From your statement it sounds like it is working without issue for you.By just skimming the specifications I don't see a reason they cannot be used together. Your low voltage memory will operate at 1.5v when mixed with 1.5v memory, and they will negotiate down to the lowest common frequency.You should avoid mixing memory within a memory grouping(1-4, 5-8, 9-12). The memory you have is similar enough that you can probably mix it, but it should be avoided if possible.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_275,275

"Epg_Dell,The process outlined in the post you mentioned was to identify the Dimm with the issue, since you know the issue involves Dimm B1, the process won't be nessacary. What I would recommend is to schedule a maintenance time to down the server, then swap the dimm in B1 with another MATCHING dimm, from within the server. Then when you power up you can see if the error remains at B1, identifying an issue with the slot, or if the error follows the dimm, which identifies the dimm as the issue. That should let us know where the issue is. If the error clears completely, it may have just been that the dimm needed to be reseated.Let me know what the results are from swapping the dimms location.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"Some vendors purchase Dell hardware and configure to their needs - Symantec, Google, etc. - may purchase non-labeled (white-box) Dell hardware, then create their own appliance, so they don't have to go to the expense of building their own servers.

These machines often have custom firmware as well to meet the needs of the appliance it was purchased to become.You may be able to force-flash the firmware, but you risk bricking it in that case.If you purchased this to put into production for business, I would recommend you return it and purchase a legitimately-Dell model.

"Hello finaria, Thank you for choosing Dell. General memory module installation in case of R730XD is follow: RDIMMs and LRDIMMs must not be mixed.x4 and x8 DRAM based memory modules can be mixed. For more information, see the Mode-specific guidelines section.Up to three dual- or single-rank RDIMMs can be populated per channel.Up to three LRDIMMs can be populated per channel regardless of rank count.If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration.Populate memory module sockets only if a processor is installed. For single-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 are available. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 and sockets B1 to B12 are available.Populate all the sockets with white release tabs first, followed by the black release tabs, and then the green release tabs.When mixing memory modules with different capacities, populate the sockets with memory modules with highest capacity first. For example, if you want to mix 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules, populate 8 GB memory modules in the sockets with white release tabs and 4 GB memory modules in the sockets with black release tabs.In a dual-processor configuration, the memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 for processor 1, then populate socket B1 for processor 2, and so on.Memory modules of different capacities can be mixed provided other memory population rules are followed (for example, 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules can be mixed).Mixing of more than two memory module capacities in a system is not supported.Populate four memory modules per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance. Source: https://dell.to/3bAglGW  For PowerEdge R930 general memory module installation guidelines are follow: Populate DIMM sockets only if a processor is installed. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12, B1 to B12 and sockets C1 to C12, D1 to D12 are available. Each processor requires a minimum of 2 DIMMs, which must be identical.Populate all sockets with white release lever first, then black, and then green.Populate the sockets by highest rank count in the following order — first in sockets with white release levers, then black, and then green. For example, if you want to mix single-rank and dual-rank RDIMMs, populate single-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with white release tabs and dual-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with black release tabs.The memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 and B1 for processor 1, then populate socket C1 and D1 for processor 2, and so on.Memory modules of different sizes can be mixed provided that other memory population rules are followed (for example 8 GB and 16 GB memory modules can be mixed).Populate four DIMMs per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance.If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration. Source: https://dell.to/2YeaPa0 In case you have failed DIMM_A4, you need to replace it.

So, the tool may provide you some information but in an actual environment, the actual figures may vary. So, to answer if the reported levels are correct, yes it is but in an ideal environment. Yes, rack servers are more silent, funny ain't it? I have a very similar case about sound cap feature on tower and rack. Only 14G rack servers have sound cap option. That option enables you to have a more silent fan running. Though, do have in mind that, servers need good ventilation. On power consumption, it's definitely draws more power when you have 2 CPUs, as the hardware needed to run 2 CPUs are also doubled.  My opinion best is to contact our sales rep if you need more information on the server's hardware.  Do let me know if you have other questions.DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"Your post gave me just enough information to finally figure this out, so thank you.I was misunderstanding how EFI boot works in general (I'm a little bit TOO old school sometimes), and this got me over the final hump. The link was very helpful. I'm just so used to using the easy-button in the lifecycle controller, the non-standard approach was throwing me off.For anyone else reading, if you are trying to do non-Dell device firmware updates such as Intel NIC's in efi file format, go to the link above and get the ""shell.efi"" file, and put in in a directory on your fat32 formatted USB stick like this: /efi/boot/Shell.efi, then rename the file to Boot64.efi. When done, you should have  /efi/boot/Boot64.efi.  In addition, copy any firmware files or programs you may need into a separate directory on the same usb stick for use after you get the shell running.Plugin your USB stick to the machine you are working with and set your BIOS to boot UEFI mode, then on post, press F11 to enter the one shot UEFI boot manager. Once there, select your USB stick from the list, and the machine should boot into the EFI shell from the USB stick. After that, just google for the commands that the EFI shell will accept.Those were my steps used on R730, R730XD,, and R620 equipment. Also to note, I tried using the remote mapping of the USB stick using the iDRAC virtual media and updated 2 units remotely and it works fine. Just keep in mind that in the F11 boot menu, the ""virtual floppy"" will be the device you select as there will be no remote USB in the list. I would also not try to update firmware remotely unless you have a rock-solid and reliable network connection... any interruption in the flashing process can and probably will render the device dead.Thanks again Martin!View solution in original post",doc_433,433

I therefore searched up how to reinstall the grub loader and the problem was solved.Problem: Ubuntu doesn't boot up without booting installation USB- System hangs on bootCause: Grub loader is not installed correctly.Solution: After booting to Ubuntu via installation USB, install grub loader correctly using the following commands:sudo grub-install /dev/sdasudo update-grubYou can then reboot the system normally and the error should no longer come up.Source: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing refer to ""Reinstalling GRUB 2 from working system.""View solution in original post",doc_438,438

"HelloI put the logs in a spoiler tag to make the thread easier to read. In the future, if you want to add logs to a thread then please either attach a file or provide a URL to a text sharing site instead of copying and pasting logs into a post. Log snippets are fine, but large snippets or full logs don't belong in the post body.These look like bad block errors to me. Bad blocks happen with drives, they are fairly common. If multiple bad blocks are found on a drive then it could be a sign that the drive is going to fail. Once the disk crosses a threshold for bad blocks the SMART on the disk will report the drive as predictive failure. If I had several drives that were reporting bad blocks then I would be proactive about replacing them. If it was just one drive and I had good backups then I would wait for it to go predictive failure before replacing. I didn't notice any of the drives being predictive failure in the logs.I would also run a consistency check. It is good to run consistency checks at regular intervals or when disk issues are encountered. A consistency check will verify the data is intact.

The problem that was being stated on the first link was that they didn't have the proper number of  dimms to fully populate all 3 memory channels, so if he didn't have enough dimms to cover all of channel 3, then those dimms that are in that channel would have to be removed. That was what was being stated.  An example of this would be like the issue you are asking. If you have 12 slots on the servers and they are split into 3 channels, you then want to upgrade with say 8 8GB and 4 4GB dimms. You could do this up to the last channel, due to there being an off number then you don't have enough of both to cover pairing against all the channels. That's not an issue with your case though, so not a concern. What you will need to do is place the 16gb dimms in the white tabbed slots and the 8GB dimms in the black. Then so long as you are in Optimizer mode in the BIOS for the memory mode then ýou should be golden. In regards to the R620, you are correct, there shouldn't be any issue.Let me know if this helps answer your questions. DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"The latest 1.9.0 Bios still has the issue.  I started to investigate how to edit the DMI/SMBIOS table.  I found a tool from American Megatrends (Bios on T30 is American Megatrends, or AMI for short), it is called DMIEDIT.  When I open DMIEdit I can see the family name is set to HEX 90 1C.  Assuming these are hex for ascii characters, this means 90 does not exist and 1C is for a file separator, probably the reason for the issue.  Running DMIEDIT in the GUI you can edit the field, deleting the 2 characters and replacing it with a space (HEX 20) and pressing ""update all"" fixes the issue.  This only works until you reboot.  I created a startup task in windows to run the command line version on DMIEDIT to edit the field on every boot.  Something like DMIEDIT.exe /SF "" "" works.Kind of a hack but Dell has not fixed the issue in some time, not sure they ever will.FixBroke View solution in original post",doc_495,495

"Linxxs,Sorry you're having memory issues with the server. The first issue you are seeing , which when trying to mix the dimms together, is that the new dimms you purchased are Rdimms. The original dimms you have in the server are Udimms, which Rdimms and Udimms can't be mixed in the same system. Hence the No Post you are seeing.Now when installing just the 4GB Rdimms, the reason for the ""Non-Optimal"" error is that with the R715 with dual rank Rdimms, optimal would be 1333mhz dimms, where the 4GB rdimms you ordered are 1066mhz. Now these dimms will work in the server, but is not Optimal, hence the error.Just a side note when considering the options, with Udimms you are limited to just 2gb dimms, so expanding to would only allow you to add more 2gb dimms. With the rdimms you can run as is, but will have the error, or you can trade them in for 1333mhz dimms.Just some things to consider.Let me know if this helps.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"WingDog,The issue you are running into is with memory channel matching. Although mixing SR and DR dimms is supported, you will still have to match  the dimm layout across the memory channels. As seen below, the channels cover 3 dimm groups per processor.With you only having 4 of the DR dimms, you wouldn't be able to populate across all three channels per side. What I suggest is that you place the DR dimms in the slots you have them in, so A1, A2, B1, and B2. With the SR dimms though you need to place them in A4, A5, A7,A8, B4, B5, B7, and B8.

You should not be considering moving the PERC 6 VD to a PERC 5.Because the PERC 5 and 6 are both supported on the 2970, the fact that some have PERC 5's probably also means their firmware is older.

"No problem. Let's first talk about the channels. You'll have your A bank and your B banks, which will be made of channels 0, 1, and 2 each. Channel 0 is A1 and A4 for processor 1 and B1 and B4 for processor 2. Slots 2 and 3 (for each bank) would have their own channels (IE channel 1 in the A bank is A2, but B2 in the B bank). Do you know if your server is has one or two processors? If only one, we just need to be concerned with the A bank. If you have 2 processors, we'll want to populate the A bank correctly, then mirror that configuration to the B bank. What I'd consider trying in a 2 proc config would be:A1, B1: 32GBA2, B2: 16GBA3, B3: 16GB Be advised though, this config may still not work. The manual doesn't explicitly call out support for 32GB DIMMs and I don't see any in my parts list. I do see some 16GB dual-rank RDIMMs, so I don't expect issues there. I'm just not 100% on the 32GB DIMMs. That said, they may still work fine.

"The idrac and LifeCycle Controller are 2 halves of the same coin. ideally you want to update them both to the latest version on the support site. Because you are running Ubuntu, that might be a little more difficult if the Dell Update Packages (DUPs) dont run correctly under that OS. I have not tried it on that one.  there are a few ways to tackle this:1. if you can download the idrac and LC dups and run them from within the OS, that would be easiest2. you could try pulling power from the system for 30 seconds to reset the LC, plug power back in, then wait at least 1 minute before actually powering on the system. It is crucial that you wait so the idrac can complete its bootup while the system is off. if you have the small lcd on the front of the system, once it responds to buttons, power on the system.3. if step 2 clears the message and you can F10 into the LC, use the Platform Update function to update the LC. 4. its possible that you may have an old enough idrac and LC that you MUST use an OS based update package, and if that is the case, and step 1 doesnt work for you, then you will need to do one of two things. a. you can use the omsa live disc to boot from, then run the idrac and lc dups from a usb key.           linux.dell.com/.../om71-firmware-liveb. install and create a repository with repository manager 1.5, then create a bootable update disc for your model system.there is a video at this location that can show you how to create a bootable iso for your system. en.community.dell.com/.../1767.dell-repository-manager.aspxthere is a 3rd option called the systems build and update utility, which you can boot to, but then you will need the Dell Server Update Utility 7.1.1 or later for the update packages.  This iso is 5+GB and requires a Dual Layer disc.

Remove all USB devices before to start power drain, please 1. Power the server down.2. Disconnect server from all power cables, Network cables.3. Hold down the power button continuously for at least 10 seconds.4. Insert power cables and network cables back to the system.5. Wait about 2 minutes before powering on server to give the iDRAC time to initialize.6. Power the system on. If still the same issue persists then you can try to soft reset iDRAC via ""i"" button Before that please check, Can you access to iDRAC? For PowerEdge servers using iDRAC7 and upwards, a small button that is marked ""i"" (Figures 1 & 2) is on the front panel of many tower and rack systems. In order to reboot the iDRAC, press the button for at least 30 seconds. Stop pressing the button when the cooling fans start spinning at full speed and the front LCD (if given) is turning off.

"Hello sci-hpc, I'm sorry to see the failed drives. I would recommend to consider if you have a backup and  if you need this data but do not have a valid backup that you should contact a Data Recovery company. Along with what Shine mentioned; the other very concerning thing I see is all the drives report 0GB in size (capacity).Do the drives spin up? Are there any lights lit on the drives? I can't imagine this happen with just a restart unless some previous issues have been occurring or you have experienced an issue that regular firmware updates could have mitigated. The system is very far behind in firmware and it could be some issue happened that may have been resolved with regular updates. I can't say for sure I'm just trying to give possibilities. Have you reviewed the iDRAC System Event Log for any issues before this happened? So after you consider the status of your backup you can try these steps below. I say to consider if you need data recovery as any troubleshooting could make it harder for data recovery if it is possible at all.  The array configuration is stored in two places; the drives and the controller.You may try shut down, unseat all drives, boot to the controller and  clear the configuration and shut down.Then seat all the drives and boot into the Controller BIOS to see if it imported the arrays or has a foreign configuration that you can import. Next steps you can update the system firmware and retry to import:You will need to step up the BIOS and iDRAC together iDRAC is thirteen revisions behind2.63.60.62, A0027 May 2019Do 7th2.61.60.60, A0005 Dec 2018 2.60.60.60, A0025 Jun 2018Do 6th2.52.52.52, A0006 Mar 2018 2.50.50.50, A0026 Sep 2017Do 5th2.41.40.40, A0014 Nov 2016 2.40.40.40, A0012 Oct 2016 2.30.30.30, A0030 Mar 2016Do 4th2.21.21.21, A0009 Nov 2015 2.20.20.20, A0010 Sep 2015Do 3rd2.15.10.10, A0025 Jun 2015 2.10.10.10, A0005 Apr 2015Do 2nd1.66.65, A0001 Dec 2014Do 1st1.57.57, A0006 May 2014 You are here   BIOS is seven revisions behind2.8.001 Oct 2019Do 7th2.7.027 Jun 2018Do 6th2.6.107 Mar 2018Do 5th2.5.417 Feb 2016Do 4th2.5.201 Apr 2015Do 3rd2.4.309 Oct 2014Do 2nd2.2.330 May 2014Do 1st2.2.206 Mar 2014You are here I can't tell about the PERC controller or the hard drive firmware.You can find the firmware here : https://dell.to/3jIShZB Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

It is seamless, you don't have to do anything to run an application in WOW64. It has been used for any applications that have been installed that are not native 64 bit applications since 2003 x64.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384249(v=vs.85).aspxSome hardware firmware updates do have 64 bit versions, but for the most part separating the updates in 32 bit and 64 bit versions provides no benefit as it is updating the firmware and not a normal running application and the benefits that 64 bit applications provide are not needed for an updater, as it won't need more than 4GB of memory, or the better memory addressing that 64 bit applications provide. In production applications 64 bit is a big advantage but for an update that runs a single time and is not needed after that it is not improving the experience. Thanks,DELL-Josh CrSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"Rob_991,The issue you are running into is due to the R710 needing the 3 memory channels to match.  Each nine-socket set is organized into three channels with three memory sockets per channel. As shown below each processor has 3 memory channels, which when required to match, only allows a single channel to be populated.  So with only having a couple of 16GB dimms, you are only able to populate a channel on each side. What I would suggest is adding a couple more 16GB dimms and populate A1, A2, B1, B2 with them, and then place 4GB in A4,A5,A7, and A8, as well as B4, B5, B7, and finally B8. That gives you two channels on each side, as well as 96GB of memory. Let me know if this helps answer your question.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"Jbonpland,There are multiple ways of updating the BIOS on the R910. One of the easiest is using one of the Dell Update Packages, dependent on the OS used. There are some things to consider when updating the BIOS as well is how far behind it is, if the server is drastically out of date then it isn't recommended to go to the current version. It is best to walk the updates up. Now with updating the Raid Controller and Drac there is 2 answers. First is that with the iDrac you need to update it with the BIOS. If both are out of date then walk both up simultaneously. If you update the BIOS and leave the ESm far back then there can be a lose of communication between the two. So something to keep in mind. The second answer would be that with the Raid controller, if you are already going to bring the server down to update the other two then might take advantage of the maintenance window and update the server fully. Let me know what OS you are using and I can get you the information needed.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"Hello,The EOL date is 5 years from sale, with the exception being when hardware is available, it may extend that time to 7 years.  As for RHEL 8, if it is going to be designated as a supported OS, I wouldn't expect it for a quarter or two. Updates generally come out in quarterly releases and I wouldn't expect support for a quarter or two, depending on if this is something being worked on. I'm in the process of downloading a RHEL 8 .ISO, and I'd be happy to attempt to install it on a 12G and let you know if it succeeds, if you like.RHEL 8 is supported on the newer 13G and 14G platforms, however. EDIT: I was successful in installing RHEL 8 on an R620, and it appears to work just fine. In my case, the installer did not see the storage attached to the PERC H310 however, and I wound up installing to a USB. The RAID controller shows up in lspci as ""LSI Logic / Symbios Logic MegaRAID SAS 2008 [Falcon] (rev 03)."" I did not try manually loading a driver, but I did see that RHEL 8 uses a newer kernel, so I would not expect the RHEL 7 driver to work, since it was for an older kernel. You might try it, but from what I've seen so far, I would not expect it to work.

"Ghadiyadhruvik,The memory population rules will be specific to each server models, so you would need to be more specific on which server you need it for.Now as far as the differences in the dimms. RDIMMS - RDIMMs add a register, which buffers the address and command signals.The integrated memory controller in the CPU sees the register instead of addressing the memory chips directly.UDIMMS - The memory controller inside your CPU addresses each memory chip of your UDIMM individually and in parallel. However, each memory chip places a certain amount of capacitance on the memory channel and thus weakens the high frequency signals through that channel. As a result, the channel can only take a limited number of memory chips.LRDIMMS - Load Reduced DIMMs replace the register with an Isolation Memory Buffer component. The iMB buffers the Command, Address, and data signals.Let me know what model server you are working with and I can get the specific memory population rules for you. You can also find the memory population rules in the manual for that specific system.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"Hello.Yes, it is by design. The iDRAC Express does NOT allow you to use a dedicated NIC for remote access but rather use one of the LAN on Motherboard (LOM) as a shared port. Now, once you have Teaming on the LOM ports, then the iDRAC Express can no longer share any the ports with the team. The workaround is to upgrade to iDRAC Enterprise that uses a dedicated port separate from the NIC Team for management traffic.

"HelloThe system will have varying levels of acoustic output based on utilization. If the system is at idle it will be very quiet, but if the system is being highly utilized it will put out much more heat and cause the fans to run at much higher RPM.If this is a parity array then a rebuild will cause the controller to perform many calculations above normal operations. It will also cause all of the drives in the array to put off more heat while the controller reads from each of them.If the fans continue at high RPM after the rebuild is complete then I would suggest reviewing the thermals throughout the system.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_650,650

Pick the matrox video driver. After that everything went buttery smooth.The frustrating thing is that this is a very simple issue to have a workaround, yet there is no mention anywhere in the Dell tech support documents, even though quite a number of 12th generation servers that have been certified as compatible with Server 2016 (I do remember somewhere in some obscure document a mention that the video card is an issue with server 2016, but there was no advice given). Better yet, Dell should just make Server 2016 an option in the lifecycle controller OS deployment ->it would make life easier for everyone since most other drivers are inbox with the server 2016 installation media. As well, check the device manager after install (right click on ""this pc"" on the desktop and select properties, then look in the upper left corner -> I had to manually install a number of drivers from windows update ->just right click on any devices that server 2016 did not recognize and pick update driver. Cheers. View solution in original post",doc_659,659

"red_gOOner,The issue you are seeing is likely due to the server having been an OEM version R710. Which entails it being loaded with a custom BIOS. If the server was at the OEM 2.2.1 and then flashed back over to the standard BIOS, then it will continue to not show the BIOS information. What we will need to do is to-Flashing the system with the 3.0.0 or later OEM bios update (using /forcetype switch) this will take the system back to OEM status.  Then -Reboot and boot to Windows, run the 6.0.7 DUP, which will then apply successfully and turn the OEM box to Dell Branded, with bios versioning information this time being intact upon reboot. After that then you can update the BIOS back up to the latest version as you had. Let me know how it goes.  DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"As expected, this is a long standing issue with Dell firmware. From their own documentation for previous generation servers-A system configured as non-RAID has a higher noise level than a system configured as RAID. With non-RAID, the temperature of the hard disk drives is not monitored, which causes the fan speed to be higher to ensure sufficient cooling resulting in higher noise levelA bit of Googling shows the problem has only gotten worse with the next generation of tower servers having low quality, noisy fans and still don't allow a negative fan offset in situations like this.  View solution in original post",doc_699,699
"If I add another regular server-compatible NIC card (not an NDC), will the Lifecycle Controller be able to detect the new card?I don't understand why you are concerned with the iDRAC and LCC with your custom OS install. You can use the iDRAC to mount your OS image, but everything past that point should have nothing to do with the iDRAC or LCC.Mount your ISO using the iDRAC and boot from it. Once it is booted from your ISO it is no different than booting from a DVD/CD. If it is not detecting the network adapter then the issue is likely a driver problem with your OS media.I don't think this issue has anything to do with the hardware. This is likely either an issue with the driver on your OS media or the installation script. I would suggest booting to your install media to see if it is detecting the network adapter properly. That should be a good starting point to determine whether you need to add additional drivers to the media or make changes to your script for the install to work.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_700,700

"Hello.I've built about 7 Poweredge R710 systems with HCR2Y PERC H700 controllers over the last month or so, and i've noticed that the NU209 batteries we've attached to them have shown up as failed after about 20-30 minutes in every case.  Date code is 02/16 on these.  We can put an older NU209 battery with a date code from say, 2012, and it appears to work fine.  Any idea what the heck is going on? Not so sure why this is associated with the same date code. Try to initiate a battery learn cycle during which time the charge on the battery will completely be drained and then recharged. Use this command: omconfig storage battery action=startlearn controller=id battery=id , where id is the controller ID and battery ID as reported by the omreport command. To obtain controller ID use omreport storage controller to display the controller ID(s) andomreport storage battery controller=ID to display the controller battery ID.Reading the H700 manual, it looks like these controllers shipped with 1 of 3 cache options.  a 512 BBU, a 512 non-volatile, and a 1GB non-volatile.  Since the HCR2Y is a 1GB model, i figured it would have to be non-volatile i.e. not in need of a battery, so i disconnected it.  Upon reboot, it now whines that there is no battery connected.  I also tried attaching the 1GB Cache dimm directly to the main controller board with the same battery cable, and got the same ""battery missing"" message.  Those two theories appear to be out.You still need this battery. In the 512 non-volatile cache option, the battery enables the transfer of data from this cache to the system flash memory for data retention for a couple of years in event of sudden power outage. View solution in original post",doc_704,704

"I've never had too much of an issue jumping small numbers of versions at a time. The BIOS is already up to date in your post (6.6), so that much doesn't need to be worried about. For the iDRAC, I'd update to 1.99, then 2.80 (oldest 2.x version I'm seeing hosted) then to the current 2.92 version. iDRAC6's web update interface is for the iDRAC firmware only, it may also work for the BIOS (it's been too long since I've needed to test or check, so take this with a grain of salt). That said, with the BIOS already being up to date, that's a bit of a moot point. Your other items, like any PCI NICs or a PERC, wouldn't be updatable through the web interface, though. If you only have 1x of these systems, I'd go ahead do the updates this way.

"UPDATE! SWAPPED TO DIFFERNET CHASSISThanks for your reply, Stefan — I was nearly certain firmware update wouldn't work if I couldn't even probe to get the existing version so didn't think it was a good idea to try.  I get very anxious doing firmware updates for fear of bricking something.But interesting news! I swapped for a different chassis today and fans seem like they are WORKING great now. Still need to mess with the system to see if they are adjusting speed properly. There are SO many settings and data points available in iDRAC that I was not seeing before. As I'm new to Dell enterprise hardware I had no idea what I should be seeing. But a BIG clue to anyone else facing these types of symptoms -- I was not seeing power supply info, fan speeds and the message ""RAC0709: Unable to retrieve the fan information"" as I mentioned in original post were conditions suggesting that the sled was not properly communicating with the chassis.Once I powered up this chassis with only a single power supply inserted, I immediately got flashing power button and indicator lights that I hadn't seen on the previous chassis.So something was definitely wrong with that previous chassis.  Among the theories I have been mulling over that may have been the issue with the original chassis I had....missing cable connection somewhere (this seems most straightforward)bad fan controller/power distribution board (I think they are integrated together?)Other chassis was configured for C6320P and I was using C6320 sleds. In my research I found some information that said this could cause fan problems (perhaps in early firmware). Also note: RAC0709 error is listed in some Dell docs as ""Unknown Server Inserted Into Chassis"" instead of ""Unable to retrieve fan information"" as displayed under fan information when my sleds were in the other chassis.Corrupted firmwareIncompatible firmware (I've heard that if some firmware gets too far ahead of other firmware sometimes it is necessary to regress firmware versions in some devices in order to update the lagging one)Fan settings hard coded or corrupted by a previous user (although that doesn't explain why probing the board via IPMI failed)So here are what I think are clues that the sled(s) are not communicating with the chassis (my theory as to the issue I was facing)….No Fan Speeds in iDRAC + ""RAC0709: Unable to retrieve the fan information"" errorNo Power Supply Info (removing power in one PSU and/or removing secondary PSU should bring up error state and flashing lights on chassis)No Inlet Temp Sensors alongside CPU Temp readings in iDRACUnable to Probe FCB Firmware via IPMIAll that stuff and more now appears in my iDRAC interface.  Having not been a Dell or PowerEdge C user before I didn't know how much was missing.I still plan to update firmware and will update this thread with any info that might be helpful.   I can now probe for versions using IPMI….  so I think I have 1.25 versionipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.50.16 -U root -P ***** raw 0x30 0x1201 7e 1b 01 25 00 00 00 00 01 ff 00 01 24 2e ffff 0f c2 00 00 01 04 01 04 31 c5 11 ff 0fView solution in original post",doc_749,749

I had a 6 minute boot time, got the extended monitor to work once, then epic fail on each restart. I concluded the NVS 290 definitely does not work.* Tried an Nvidia NVS 280, PCIe-x16 as suggested in another post I read. I nodded the cars by removing pins 50-52. Installed the cars in PCIe-1.

Conclusion, the NVS 280 does not work.What finally did work for me!* I accidentally stumbled across an Nvidia NVS 285, PCIe-x16, HP model P283. Instead of modifying this card, I used a x8 to x16 ribbon cable, and installed the card in the PCIe-1 slot after removing the DRAC card.* I booted the computer perfect. No hangs, no bangs, even scanning the raid drives and everything, I had a total boot time of under two minutes. I don't know of this will work on any other system, model, or configuration, but this exact card, a P283 using a ribbon cable in slot 1 worked for me.

"We only validate drives running our firmware on the PERC H330. We do not block non-Dell drives, but we can't say with any certainty whether or not they will work.The H330 supports drives larger than 2TB, so the drive size should not be a reason it is not functioning properly. This is most likely a firmware communication issue. If the drives are not being detected in the controller BIOS then I would try these things:Make sure the drives is properly seated in the backplane or to the cable if it is a cabled configuration. I show you have an 8 drive backplane, so make sure the drives are properly inserted into the carrier. Also, make sure the carrier is properly inserted into the backplane. The latch should be in the open position when you insert the carrier, if the carriers are the latch style. If the drive is not properly inserted in the carrier or the carrier is not properly inserted into the backplane then the drive will not be connected to the backplane.Try different firmware on the drive and controller. You may be able to find a firmware combination that allows the controller and drive to properly communicate.Install an interposer. An interposer will change the way a SATA drive communicates. Anything that changes communication may allow the controller and drive to properly communicate.

Every six months to a year, the house fans get the brush/vacuum/oil treatment. As long as you catch them before they seize up and overheat, BEFORE the thermal fuse opens next to the windings, they can go for years.

The massage on the screen says that “the server does not support existing configuration of memory.”Refer to the diagram below.For optimal memory configuration, the memory installed on slots on CH0, CH1 and CH2 of CPU1 have to be balanced and hence the same. The same applies to the memory on slots of channels CH0, CH1 and CH2 of CPU2. Therefore, memory on all channels on CPU1 &CPU2 should be the same. You will need to use 4 x16GB and 4 x8GB modules with 16 GB populated on slots with white sleeves and 8 GB on black sleeves while leaving channels CH0 empty (96 GB in total). Otherwise, the configuration will not be supported.Currently, they have installed 4x16 and 4x8.. Which give us 96gb. But they say that the rest 4x8GB are incompatible with currently installed. Is this possible at all? The rest of 8gb memory sticks have same speed and type as those, that are currently installedWith the above configuration, you can not introduce 4 x8GB modules because now channels CH0 on CPU1 and CPU2 will not be balanced with the rest.Is there a way to make it 128 ? please advice!Yes you can, by using 8 x16GB modules which may not be cost effective.

"Hi Joey,Today is the day it happened!I successfully updated the iDRAC firmware to 2.65.65.65 from 2.21.21.21.Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for your help in troubleshooting the situation and sticking with me throughout this nightmare.After having tried every method under the sun, iDRAC would still not update. Luckily, I found a great guy on YouTube (shoutout to him) going over his steps to fix a bricked iDRAC. Luckily, in my situation my iDRAC wasn't necessarily 'bricked'; iDRAC had no problem working even after the hundred failed firmware update attempts that I had tried. Although my situation wasn't exactly like his, the methods used to try and treat a bricked iDRAC managed to treat mine as well.So these are the steps I took to fix this problem (For an R320 or similar) Just to be said, I am not a qualified electrician. These are purely the steps I took to overcome this problem:You will need:USB UART device, one capable of 3.3v. (Cheap from Amazon)Soldering ironSD Card in the FAT format loaded with the firmware.d7 file in the root folder.iDRAC Enterprise cardSpare PC or Laptop with PuTTY installed.Make sure you export your iDRAC license. This can be done by the web GUI. If necessary also export you iDRAC settings as this will completely wipe all iDRAC configuration.On the motherboard there will be a BMC_UART port right next to the rear I/O of the MB. The connection pinout is: R320 (or similar) BMC_UARTFunctionPin 1 (Square Pad)Vdd (3.3v)Pin 2TxPin 3RxPin 4GNDSolder 4 jumper wires onto the board and connect them to the USB UART dongle as followed. Make sure the server is off!Connect to the serial port in PuTTY with your COM interface (if you're unsure what interface to use, check device manager) with a baudrate of 115200 using TELNET. Now you can boot the server. If those steps were successful, you should now see the uboot process of the server. If it has booted successfully, you should be greeted with a linux shell but in this situation we wont be needing that. Although it's a good idea to test your UART wiring so you are able to send text to the console.This next step can be a bit tricky. You now need a paperclip or anything else you can use to short a switch on the MB. The switch is located near the large silver heatsink, named SW2. To reboot the system, short switch 1. Now this is the tricky part - quickly switch over and short switch 2 while spamming any key in the console. If you are lucky, you will see the uboot process has been interrupted and you now have an iDRAC prompt. It will look something like: iDRAC 7/8=>With the FAT formatted SD card loaded with the fimware image, run: util recover -emmc -from sd -f firmimg.d7 -noreset -clean  If you are successful, it should have erased the EMMC and installed the new firmware. You can now unplug the server when it's safe to do so and drain the power by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. Unfortunately if you were unsuccessful, you may have a bad EMMC chip, I have read that these can go bad from perhaps too many write cycles.When booting up, you may or may not have the lifecycle controller telling you an update is required or spit out a firmware error. This is ok, just reboot the server a couple times and it should return to normal. Boot into the lifecycle controller and click 'about' in the top right corner. Voila! The iDRAC firmware should now be up-to-date! To restore the iDRAC license, go to the Platform Restore section and import the license. You will need a USB stick with your exported license on it. You can now unsolder the BMC_UART connection if you wish and uninstall the SD Card from the iDRAC Card.Here is a labelled photo of the MB to guide you: Here are the forums that helped me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/ https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95 Many Thanks!View solution in original post",doc_791,791
"Hello mostavern, You are correct. You would need iDRAC Service Module or  OpenManage Server Administrator installed in the OS to configure the parameters. https://dell.to/3CusECS Automatic System Recovery Automatic System Recovery feature is a hardware-based timer, which is used to reset the server in the event of a hardware failure. You can perform automatic system recovery operations such as reboot, power cycle, or power off after a specified time interval. This feature is enabled only when the operating system watchdog timer is disabled. If OpenManage Server Administrator is installed, this monitoring feature is disabled to avoid duplicate watchdog timers. You can configure three parameters in this feature from iDRAC interfaces:     Watchdog state: The default state is enabled when OMSA is not present, and when BIOS or OS watchdog timer is disabled.    Watchdog timeout: The default value is 480 seconds. The minimum value is 60 seconds and the maximum value is 720 seconds.    Watchdog timeout Recovery Action or Auto Recovery Action: The actions can be Powercycle, Power Off, Reboot or None. Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"I'm happy to get you a contact number, what country are you in? If I can get that from you, I may be able to help you have a smoother experience. Both the 14G and 15G servers are awesome. Coming from a support viewpoint, I *VERY MUCH* like the 14G servers and the 15G are looking to be great, too.  The xd is short for ""Extra dense,"" I'm pretty sure. That said, the other suffixes aren't anything I've ever explored or tried to find what they may stand for. For example, the R730XD has more storage capacity than the R730, due to a mechanical difference in chassis design. Both the R640 and the R650 are using DDR4 memory, but the R650 is exclusively showing memory speeds of 3200MHz in my parts database. One difference is that the hardware sets that the generations get validated with get refreshed, but as you'll see in the forum, many officially unsupported pieces of hardware still work out fine. Hopefully this sheds some light, but I feel like a phone conversation may be more productive. There are similarities in hardware support, and depending on what your needs are, the 14G may be perfectly suited for them.

I added two notes clarifying that the quad rank DIMMs will operate at 800 MHz when populated 2 per channel, and that the 1066 MHz speed limitation for the 1.35v CPU applies to dual rank or higher DIMMs when populated with a minimum of 2 per channel.

"HelloYou cannot switch to using the chipset SATA controller by simply enabling it. If you were previously using an H310 then the backplane is connected to the H310. The backplane needs to be connected to the SAS/SATA connector on the system board for the chipset controller to see the drives.Also, the chipset only supports SATA. SAS drives will not work if the SAS backplane is connected to the system board. We have a SATA backplane for the configuration you are attempting. If your system was ordered with a PERC then it has the SAS backplane. SAS is backwards compatible with SATA, so I don't see a reason why the SAS backplane would not work.

"When you mix them, does the server turn on and get past the ""Configuring Memory"" message? If the system is able to work around any misconfiguration it would then prompt with details (such as available memory may be reduced, cannot put X in X slots etc).Make sure your BIOS is up to date (6.4.0) for the most up to date memory support. If you have to update the BIOS update the Lifecycle controller and iDRAC as well if needed. The standard Dell support answer is that these three items must be on current versions.If it works with the 2x8Gb and the 4x2Gb separately, check you are not trying to mix Registered/ECC memory and Unregistered memory together.

"@Neavissa, ignore your referenced post as the root cause of the problem that OP was having was an Nvidia driver change that altered the default behavior of the Telsa card in question (and none of us read NVidia's documentation untill much later). Since your using GeForce card and GeForce driver, such issues as described in that post are not really relevant to you.And the reason i modded my card was that the T610 does not have a x16 PCIe slot and i provided this info as background but it is also not directly relevant to your issue.The best thing for you to do is to download and read ""Dell Poweredge T620 Systems Owner's Manual"", also known and ""T620 HOM"". Google should be able to provide a link to the dell download page...Anyway on page 28 & 29 of this document you will find the ""Integrated device"" BIOS screen for the T620, specifically page 29 shows ""Embedded Video Controller"" and a short description... What this document does not say is that you can not change the setting unless the system detects the card is actually inserted (well that's the case on the T610 and i expect it's the same on the T620).So, if you insert a video card into your x16 slot and if you can't change the BIOS setting above, then either the card is faulty or the slot is faulty or you installed the card into a slot connected to the second processor socket in a single processor system which may not be a supported configuration.Page 129 of T620 HOM states slot 5 through 7 can't be used unless two processors are installed. So if you installed the GPU in slot 5 and only have one CPU installed, this configuration won't work, try installing the GPU in slot 2.!!If you can't access the BIOS setting for Embedded Video Controller, then this needs to be sorted out BEFORE you can proceed further, no point in trying to install drivers into the OS for a card the BIOS can't see!!! Oh, and if you do set the Embedded Video Controller to DISABLED but you still don't see any video output when you connect the monitor to the card, then you can always reset the BIOS back to default settings (which for Embedded Video Controller is ENABLED option) and reconnect your monitor back to the motherboard VGA connector. The system should work just as it did before (though you may have to go into BIOS and set those options you may have changed from their default values).How to set BIOS back to default setting is not well described in the T620 HOW but look at the NVRAM_CLR jumper shown on page 125 & 126 and you should see that setting the jumper to pins 1-3 will reset the BIOS to default on the next boot. Presumably after the reboot you shut down the system and move the jumper back to pins 3-5 !! Just got to love the Dell documentation :emotion-1:So go back to basics and tell us which slot you plugged your GeForce GTX card into and whether you can then access the Embedded Video Controller option within the Integrated Devices Screen in your T620 BIOS.

"Bradje1,To start, the fields on the right side of your screenshot will NOT be accessible until after Leader is selected and the Group Name entered, then select apply. If it isn't allowing that then based on the screenshot, you haven't completely disbanded the previous Chassis Group. I can determine this by the fact the Username and password are populated, which would only occur from a previous membership. When there isn't a configuration present, it will be blank and grayed out. Once Leader is selected and the Group Name entered, you would select Apply and then those fields are accessible. Now to disband a chassis group from the lead chassis you do the following:Login with administrator privileges to the leader chassis.Select the Lead chassis in the tree.Click Setup > Group Administration .In the Chassis Group page, under Role, select None, and then click Apply.The lead chassis then communicates to all the members that they have been removed from the group. Finally the lead chassis discontinues its role. It can now be assigned as a member or a leader of another group. Now if this member chassis didn't receive the message, due to a network issue or being removed. Then you will need to disable the member from the member chassis to complete the removal. After that then you should be able to proceed..Let me know if this helps resolve the issue.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"HelloI'm unaware of a white paper that explains the cache options. The options are explained in the OMSA storage manual, page 48. The second storage manual on the page is the correct link. I have already reported that the installation guide is mislabeled as the storage manual:www.dell.com/support/home/product-support/product/dell-openmanage-server-administrator-9.0.1/manualsWhy is the SAS cache disabled? I thought it would make the disk faster to Enable it.Yes, enabling the disk cache should increase performance, but it is not battery backed. If there is a sudden loss of power or a hardware failure in the RAID chain there is an increased chance of data loss/corruption if the disk cache is enabled.I don't know the reason why we enable SATA cache by default, but I suspect it is likely due to complaints about performance on SATA drives.

"Hello, Yes, it is doable. I am currently running 4x K80 in my server, which is essentially an 8x GPU setup. Runs great. You just need to note some parts as you set them up.Power breakout board: I think it is called a ""power distribution"" board, but check the parts for them. That board is located at the bottom of the motherboard. Lift up the MOBO, insert the power board in the extended slot (pretty easy), and insert the MOBO back.Power cable: Pin layout of this power board and the cable is basically an 8x PCIe power layout. PCIe in, PCIe out. (3 yellow power and black ground pairs, with 1 pair of ground). The problem is that, K80 uses a CPU power layout (4 yellow power and black ground pairs). You need an adapter or appropriate cable (Search for PCIe male to CPU or ATX male). We rewired the cables ourselves.https://i.stack.imgur.com/Spsgx.pngFrom the specification of the board, each slot of the power breakout board can carry 300W (standard design is supposed to be 150W instead of 300W, so this is special for the T630), so it has no problem supporting 1 K80 each. So, one PCIe power slot would split into 2 CPU power slots. We have been running it fine for 2 years now, no problem. Be careful to pick a good power cable though. Thing is, you will read online that standard PCIe slots can only support 150W, and when running it, the T630 will give a notification of ""power overloading"". If you want to be safe, you can just do 2x K80.Install a stronger power supply. There are two slots for the PSU, dont care about the 2nd, they dont add to your system. You need a single strong PSU. The second is the spare PSU, which is there to ensure power redundancy.Fan array : With the GPU installed, the server won't run without the fan array (4-fan array in the middle of the chassis). Problem is, these fans are completely useless in cooling down the K80s. Therefore, you can just buy some jumpers or something to bypass it. Or just install the fan array per the requirement.Fan mod: K80s need a fan directly attached on one end of it, being a passive cooling solution. We just attach two server fans at the backend of the chassis, they cool the K80s down fine. Cover the slots where there are no GPU, leave only the ones with the GPU opened to increase pressure into them.View solution in original post",doc_935,935

"Dell PE servers like the Tx30's series towers, only supports compute cards when configured with the GPU Installation Kit and the gruntier PSU's at the time of placing your order. In this way, the server has the required GPU auxilary power connectors required by many compute cards that Dell certifies (along with other mechanical bits to presumably hold the cards safely).However, it must be noted that Dell does not support graphics functions via PCIe graphics cards like the Quadro P4000 you mentioned. Dell only supports compute cards intended to provide processing grunt - not graphics :emotion-18:Obviously that does not mean PCIe graphics features will not work in this server, only that Dell will not support such configurations if you have issues. In such cases where you have issues with graphics, or use of non certified cards, you'd be on your own.Just be warned that should you install a graphics card into a PE server and it provides your graphics function, rather than offloading compute tasks, some management features may not be accessible (since they are provided to the DRAC by the integrated graphics which would be disabled ).As a side note, the PE server i have looked at is teh T630 which is a 2 socket tower server that allows up to 4 GPU compute cards to be installed but dependant on a number of condiitions/configurations of the server itself. Other PE servers modles may differ as to the number of suppoted compute cards.I've not seen any specific Dell doc that state which servers support which compute cards and how many they actually can support, so unless others know and can share you'll have to do lots of reading :emotion-43:Finally, it must also be noted that the GPU Installation Kit is not a self installed kit that one can 'order' with the hope of 'upgrading' a server post sale. As such it's wrong to call it a kit which is why i hate it being called that, it should be called GPU Installation Option' within the Dell PE custom configuration web page! So don't expect you can buy a server and then later upgrade it with a simple kit you can buy.

"HelloI know that with certain other manufacturers, installing unknown PCIe cards cause their fans to go nuts as they assume the cards are overheating.  How do Dell servers deal with this, in particular the R310?Unknown/3rd party PCIe cards will cause 13g servers and likely all later generations to run fans at maximum RPM regardless of temperature. To my knowledge this is new with our 13g servers. I do not believe previous generations like 11g detected what exactly was populated in the PCIe slots. They changed fan thresholds based on whether or not the slots were populated not based on what was in the slot.I can't say for sure what the decibels will be. We do not have a list of all possible configurations and the decibels. The highest listed configuration in my data sheet does not include add-on PCIe cards, but the listed dBA under stress with that population is 43. I can't guarantee that the system will operate under 60 dBA, but I suspect that it will.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_949,949

"Phykell,The answer would be based on the amount of processors installed. In populating the server the guidelines you need to adhere to, and make sure the new dimms aren't violating is; 1) you can't mix Rdimms and Udimms, so ensure that they are the same. 2) is that when populating you must make sure the channels match. 3) The larger dimms must be 1st in the channels. So hypothetically if you were to have 2 processors, 24 dimms (8 16GB and 16 8GB). You can place the 16GB dimms in the slots with the white tabs and then the 8GB in the green and black lots.

"Thank you for the service tag.There is not a process for removing a TPM, so there are no step-by-step instructions or a support article that I can provide on how to perform this action. The TPM is optional at time of purchase. The system can be purchased without a TPM or with several types of TPM.The system should be able to operate without error after the TPM is removed if all TPM features are disabled. If any features requiring a TPM are enabled then there will be errors. Resetting defaults, clearing NVRAM, and draining flea power after removing the TPM should reset all settings to factory defaults. All TPM features should be disabled at factory defaults.You can reference the system manual TPM section for warnings about removing TPM. For instance, the TPM module cannot be re-used once it has been removed from the system.

"""As I understand it (please let me know if I’m wrong), RAID10 has the benefit of increased read and write speeds""True, but the writes still have a delay as raid 1, the controller cache relieves most of it.

"Paw0702,Did the error happen to start during a power up or while it was running normally? If it did it on power up then we can try the following procedure to clear the issue.1.       Power off the system if it is not already powered off2.       Remove AC cord, wait for standby voltage to dissipate (10-20 secs or no LEDs visible and no LCD illumination)3.       Remove the G memory riser identified by the E1234 4.       Check the memory riser for any damaged components. Also, make sure the heat sink clip is installed correctly. Then leave the riser out of the system until step 10)    5.       Install a jumper on pins 5-6 of the jumper block labeled “J_DBGCPLD1” which is located near the iSCSI key connector (which looks like a phone jack) as seen below. There isn’t a jumper installed on this block from the factory, so you will need to borrow one from the  NVRAM_CLR/PASS_EN block or get it externally.7.       Apply AC.  Wait ~45 seconds to a minute for the iDRAC to be initialized. The front LCD will flicker momentarily and you can see the LCD interactive when it is initialized. The power fault message will be cleared from the LCD message queue.   8.       Remove AC, wait for standby voltage to dissipate (10-20 secs or no LEDs visible and no LCD illumination)9.       Remove the jumper (if you borrowed from the NVRAM_CLR/PASS_EN block, make sure it is replaced in the proper position) 10    .

"Hello againI've already answered this question on Twitter. Asking on a different medium will not change my answer:https://twitter.com/Matteo79056944/status/708564396172320768I've contacted Dell Cares Pro service on twitter, and initially they said the only solution is to buy the spares parts of the GPU installation kit and try a ""workaround"" to solve the problem. No, that is not what I said. I said it would be best to work with the reseller to order the correct system.The Italian Dell Reseller have no problem to re-pack the server and sent it back to Dell.But we have tried about 10 times on Friday to contact by phone the DELL Customer Care in Milan but we had no luck.Resellers cannot return equipment for a refund, and we do not perform any kind of return-to-depot upgrades for our servers. The system would have to be refunded and reordered to order the GPU kit.Since you are likely to encounter issues getting a refund on a system ordered through a reseller I provided the part numbers you will need to get a GPU functioning in the system. That may be your only option.There are many ways that resellers sell systems to customers. Our resellers purchase equipment directly from us and resell it to their clients. There are resellers that merely put together quotes and have their clients order the equipment directly. I don't consider any type of sale aside from when a reseller purchases from us and resells to be a reseller purchase. Any other form of purchase is a consultation service and not a resell.If the reseller purchased from us and then resold to you then they will need to contact us about the return/refund. You should not be contacting customer care to get a refund in this scenario because you did not give us any money to refund. The refund is between us and the reseller, and part of the reseller contract is that they are not permitted returns/refunds. If you paid us directly for the system then you should be contacting customer care to request the return/refund.Returning and reordering the correct system is your best option. If that option is not available then you can attempt to order the part numbers I provided and install them yourself. GPU kits are not supported as an after-point-of-sale upgrade, so there is not a kit or process to perform the upgrade. The parts I provided are based on my research of the reference material I have available.

"Hello JohnI suspect that there is a good reason the timeout limit is set to that time. If it took 10 minutes to update one NIC then systems that are maximum populated with NICs could take quite a bit longer. If the threshold were set too low then the system could force a restart in the middle of an update and brick a NIC.At this point I am not going to create an escalation on this. If you encounter a technical issue then I will be happy to look into it and bring it to the attention of our development teams, but I see nothing wrong with the current timeout threshold.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_1026,1026

"According to your advice, I need to purchase two physical servers; 1 for DC and other 1 for virtual host.So, if you have a DC running as a virtual machine, and it is handing out DHCP and managing DNS, imagine that you accidentally reboot the server one day, it reboots on its own, or it experiences some type of hardware malfunction. Let's say you have 30 people working in the office, only 5 of whom need to access the services provided by the virtual machines, the others use web-based tools for their job. What happens is that instead of 5 people not able to do their jobs because the server is down, the other 25 can't do their jobs either, because they 1) lost their network address, 2) have no DNS, and 3) cannot authenticate to anything else on the network because there is no DC to authenticate to. Having a separate physical DC will allow you to maintain DHCP and DNS in the event that the virtual DC is unavailable.Between VMware and Hyper-V which one will work much reasonable for this type of solution?Do they run on top of OS or do they run as OS?They ARE the OS. Choosing between them is completely dependent on choice, experience, environment, and cost. Hyper-V comes included in Windows Server. There is a free stand-alone version, but if you are familiar with Windows Servers and their management, this might make more sense. Otherwise, the downfall is the purchase of a Windows Server license. VMware is free, but Support is not.

"Hello.System E1234 error is indicative of memory riser power failure that may be caused by either the DIMM(s) on the riser or the raise itself. The first thing you do is to power down the server and reseat the riser and associated DIMMs. However, it is also possible that it could be a system board issue. Have you done any troubleshooting to truck down the source of the error?  Just replacing the system board may not solve the problem. You might consider swapping the riser and when the error follows the riser; swap the DIMMs as well. This will point you to replacing either the riser or DIMM(s). But when the errors stays in the same riser position, then it could be a system board issue.View solution in original post",doc_1100,1100

"I found my answer finally from a PowerBiz Solutions article on the internet. The problem was described as being caused by having installed the NTBackup Restore Utility for Windows 7 and leaving it installed after migrating a Server from SBS2003 to SBS2011 as I had done.  It further explains that any future backups including BMR will not include contents of a specific folder c:\Windows\Registration if this condition exists.  The solution was simply to copy these files from the working server over onto a USB and then copying them into the same directory on the ""recovered"" server.  I did this and rebooted and the System came up fine, recovered to similar hardware on a different machine.  I believe the only thing I have to do now is remove the utility from the production server so the backups will be complete going forward. Hopefully others in the same situation can benefit from this information I was so fortunate to run across.Also, I think the drive letter assignments was never an issue in my case. I believe they were temporary assignment for the recovery environment, so naturally any changes I made would disappear upon reboot as I was no longer in that environment.-PatrickView solution in original post",doc_1138,1138

Note that Disk Roaming can only be performed when the server is powered down. Therefore, no need for you to re-create the VDs at the end of roaming. Disk Roaming should not be performed when you have RAID level migration and/or Online Capacity Expansion in progress as it will crush your VDs. It is advisable to backup your data before doing any maintenance.View solution in original post",doc_1191,1191

"Pavan-1,Is this occurring after an upgrade, or is this with the original dimms? Also, was this system in service when it occurred, or was this during an initial configuration? Just trying to clarify. One of the things I would start with is taking the system to the minimum memory, which would be a single dimm in slot A1. Try powering up with only the single dimm in and see if the error clears. If not then try swapping the dimm in A1 with a known good one. If a known good dimm still fails to clear the error then we are possibly looking at the problem being the slot on the motherboard.

"Hello, To begin, does the drive at least have a single solid green LED lit? It's not uncommon for someone to mistakenly mount the drive in the carrier incorrectly, which causes the drive to not seat with the backplane properly. You want to make sure that the drive is mounted such that the back of the drive is flush with the back end of the carrier. Second, what is the drive itself? Does this happen to be a Dell branded drive? Non-Dell drives generally work, but not always. Some don't negotiate a connection. If it would be easier, you could share a picture of the drive label. That would provide relevant everything about the disk. If none of that gives an answer, you can export the RAID controller log. It's a plain text file you can view in any text editor.

I didn't realize those slots changed bandwidth quite that drastically.After moving the PERC H730 back to PCIe slot 4, I'm getting 4000 MB/s read and 3700 MB/s write which is what I'd expect for 8x 500MB/s drives in a RAID 0.The PCIe slot the RAID controller was in was the bottleneck.View solution in original post",doc_1245,1245

When does it show this error occurring? Also, If you clear the hardware log 32bit diags won't report that error. With what you are describing it sounds like an OS issue, but I would suggest making sure that the server is up to date on BIOS, iDrac, and Raid Controller.  As those being excessively out of date can causes issues like this as well.  Would you also confirm what controller is installed, as well as where those devices versions are currently?Also, in the OS could you go to System - Advanced Settings - Startup and Recovery and then verify that the is NOT a checkmark in the Automatically Restart box.

"It turns out that my previous messages were on the right track. There was damage to the CPU socket, fortunately not of the replace-the-motherboard variety.I ordered a pair of CPUs (as I thought I could at least use all four DIMMs by putting two on each CPU). When I installed the first CPU I noticed something not quite right in the socket but ignored it at that point. Here's what I saw (I have circled the problem): But with the second CPU installed I was getting E1410 errors and the machine wouldn't boot so I had to take everything apart again and investigate. When I looked more closely I realised that this pin was out of place (I'm not sure if it was bent or just caught on the neighbouring pin) but I managed to get it back from the red position to the green position.That didn't solve my dual-CPU issue but I found that with one CPU, it would now see all 64GB, which it had not done before. So the original memory issue was apparently due to that pin above.Ultimately (for anyone who is interested) I did resolve the E1410 error - I think what did it was cleaning the second CPU socket by dabbing with a tissue moistened with isopropyl alcohol as Intel or Dell documentation mentions somewhere. As of now the machine boots with two L5640s and 64GB RAM (16GB in each of A1, A2, B1, B2), and I hope it will remain stable.View solution in original post",doc_1267,1267

If it returns on the original UPS the error was on with a different battery then I would suspect a faulty UPS.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_1304,1304

"HelloThere are two things to consider:#1 Are both DIMM types the same? You cannot mix UDIMMs and RDIMMs.#2 Memory is supposed to be installed in pairs, and in dual processor configurations both memory lanes(A, B) must have identical configurations. In a dual CPU configuration you should be installing a minimum of 4 DIMMs. Single DIMM configurations in A1/B1 are not intended for a production environment. That configuration is intended for troubleshooting.If all of the DIMMs are the same type then your configuration should be:1,2 - 8GB4,5 - 2GBAlternatively you could populate:1,2,3 - 2GB4,5 - 8GBThat will give you more memory, but may not perform as well as the first configuration. If the above configurations do not work then post more information about the specifications of the memory.You may be able to get the memory to work in this configuration:1,2,3 - 2GB4 - 8GBI'm quite certain that you will receive a warning with that configuration, but I'm uncertain if the DIMM would be disabled.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_1307,1307

If the iDRAC performance changes then the issue is likely with the control panel or a cable.Make sure all power is disconnected from the system when disconnecting the control panel and avoid ESD damage to any components. The two cables you will want to disconnect is the control panel ribbon cable and the USB cable. You can leave the SD module cable connected. You will need to use the iDRAC to power the system on while the control panel is disconnected.If the iDRAC performance changes with the control panel disconnected then reseat all cables to make sure they are properly seated.

Then i'd run a memory benchmark to check the performance.You could also try changing BIOS memory mode to ""Optimised"" and place the RDIMM's into the 3 white slots with the 4th in the black slot furthest from the CPU (marked A4). Then run a memory benchmark and compare with the above configuration. Either configuration should give you 32GB. You don't mention what type, size or number of DIMMs you previously had installed within your system so it's impossible to say if they can be reused or how. But since you mention you are replacing them, i guess it's not relevant anyway. However, if your old memory was UDIMM type (unbuffered = no registers on data lines), it's safe to say you can't mix UDIMM's with RDIMM's. If you old memory were RDIMM's you may be able to reuse them (but if they are not low voltage type, you will not get the low voltage benifit from your new memory as it will work at thehigher voltage and thus consume more power than would otherwise be the case).  Good luck.View solution in original post",doc_1357,1357

"2.) I tried looking all over the internet trying to figure out why channel 0 is better to put the larger?It seemed to make sense to me to put the 2 x 4GB into channel zero, as that would bring to total RAM to chan 0 = 8GB, and then if I put 8GB in the others slots, that would make all ""Channels"" equal in size, or am I missing something?I mixed up the guidelines with another familiar server. Refer to the diagram below:The memory configuration of the R410 server is rather different from the rest. Processor 1 has 2 memory banks consisting of slots A1, A2 & A3 and the other bank is just slot A4. On the other hand, Processor 2 also has 2 memory banks consisting of slots B1, B2 & B3 and the other bank is just slot B4. For optimal memory configuration, memory in each of the banks has to be the same. We do not mix the memory sizes on these banks. Accordingly, you would have as observed Slots A1, A2 &A3 and B1, B2 &B3 = 4 GB and A4 &B4 =8 GB. In this case not necessarily ""Channels"" equal in size but banks equal in size. You are not missing a thing here! For more information,see pages 119 - 123 of the Users' Guide: ftp.dell.com/.../poweredge-r410_owner's manual_en-us.pdf3.) I figured out that if I put, 4GB modules into slots 1,2,3 and 8GB into slot 4, and then reverse for the other server. I do NOT get the ""unoptimized configuration"" messages on boot. That also means I have one server with 40GB of RAM and another with 56GB of RAM which is very nonoptimal for my needs. What to do????Unfortunately, you can't achieve 48 GB of optimal memory configuration with your current memory. For optimal 48 GB of memory you will need 6x 8 GB modules populated on slots A1, A2 &A3 and B1, B2 &B3 leaving slots A4 &B4 empty or unused.View solution in original post",doc_1369,1369

"Ruifaria,Refer to the illustration below:There are guild lines to follow when populating memory on channels. The reason your server doesn’t boot when you put MEM DIMMs on A7, A8, A9 & B7, B8, B9 is due to the limitation imposed by Quad-Rank DIMM. Once the first slot in a channel, A1 or B1 is populated by Quad-Rank DIMM, then the second slot A4 or B4 should also be a Quad-Rank DIMM or other and the last slot A7 or B7 should be left vacant.As SysAdminTX said, “all memory channels (3 per processor with 3 dimm slots per channel on an R710) need to have the exact same memory dimm layout, unless the memory channel is left unpopulated (there do seems to be some exceptions to this though)”This means that the MEM DIMMs on slots A1, A4 & A7 have to be the same as DIMMs on A2, A5, A8 and A3, A6, A9. Similarly, DIMMS on B1, B4 & B7 have to be same as B2, B5, B8 and B3, B6, B9. Moreover, DIMMs A1, A4 & A7 = B1, B4 & B7 and so forth.You cannot get past 52 GB of memory because your memory channels are not balanced. The server will boot with massage,” memory configuration not optimal” You will need 4 additional Quad-Rank DIMMs for you to get optimal memory with the following matrix:A1, A2 & A3 and B1, B2 &B3 –16GBA4, A5 & A6 and B4, B5 &B6 – 2GBSee link below pages 30 to 33 for more information:www.dell.com/.../server-poweredge-r710-tech-guidebook.pdfView solution in original post",doc_1383,1383

"I think what I would want to do is get the server to the minimum to POST, power it up, and see what happens. You should be able to remove the PERC without issue, just not the riser it sits in. Min to post for this unit is as follows:•System board •Risers•Processor (CPU1) with Heatsink•Power Supply•One stick of memory in dual in-line memory module (DIMM) slot A1•Control Panel with cableEverything else (including the troublesome PERC) can get pulled. You might also look at flashing the iDRAC firmware from iDRAC Settings > Firmware Update, since the iDRAC would work with the BIOS. If it still won't POST, I'd be looking at the system board for replacement.As a point of clarification, when you said that it wouldn't start without the PERC riser, were you removing the PERC PCI card and it's riser? Or were you referring to the PERC as a riser itself? Don't want to recommend anything you'e already done,  after all. #Iwork4DellView solution in original post",doc_1400,1400

If that is the case, it would be a bit frustratingThat is exactly what I've stated multiple times. I will state it again to hopefully clear it up for you:You do NOT have a C2100. You have a DCS C2100.We have NOTHING available for a DCS system. When I say we have nothing available I mean we have NO drivers, firmware, BIOS, manuals, or any other form of documentation.You will likely be able to locate drivers for your hardware from the download pages of similar systems like the C2100, but I would not perform any BIOS or firmware updates on a DCS system unless instructed to do so from the reseller.Contact the reseller for information about your system. They are the only ones that can provide information.we just parted with an HP system because HP did not have drivers or updates for THAT device. If the device we now have also faces the problems, that's rather unfortunate.I don't seem to have done a good job explaining this to you. I've spent a lot of time trying to explain to you that you have not purchased a normal system. I'll state it again:You do NOT have a C2100. You have a DCS C2100.The DCS line of systems are custom datacenter solutions with specialty support contracts that are fulfilled by dedicated engineering teams. The company that bought this DCS system through us had a dedicated engineer they contacted for help with the system. They did not go to our public support site for downloads or documentation on their system. The warranty on DCS systems does not transfer, so you CANNOT contact that company's dedicated engineer team to request documentation, downloads, or support.If you would have purchased a C2100 or ANY of our normal systems you could get documents and downloads from dell.com/support for those systems.

"Hi Zanzaboo,I'm not aware of anything we've done to specifically disable unsupported video cards, though we definitely cannot guarantee their compatibility nor have we tested or validated them in any configuration and for that reason do not recommend them. For supported graphics cards on the T420 (which you have correctly identified as the Q4000 and Q6000), you must disable embedded video output from the BIOS/System Setup under Integrated Devices (pg 30-31, support.dell.com/.../T420OMen.pdf ) to get video out. Note that when you do this, the iDRAC virtual console video output will no longer be available until embedded video is enabled again. I don't know of any reason you cannot follow the same steps with an unsupported graphics card but I must stress we did not test or validate it and if it doesn't work you would not have any recourse under warranty (i.e. we would not replace the motherboard for a faulty PCI-e port, for example). I'm not sure if PCI-e video passthrough will work on here, but you may need to configure the SR-IOV setting (right below the embedded video setting) per the needs of your hypervisor.

"Hi @R320Cluster, OEM PowerEdge usually cater to companies that they would like to have their own brand, customize firmware to their environment requirement and customized configuration. I'll basically go straight to you questions:Is an OEM XL R720 compatible with standard Dell firmware/BIOS and associated software?No, they are not compatible with standard firmware and BIOS. Software like OMSA, OME and other applications are subject to their compatibility. Will need to check on each of the application user guide for it. Is the hardware potentially modified or substituted by Dell for a specific customer's needs?Yes, they are customized for each customer's needs. Though, we're unsure what specific customer requirements, only the customer and the Dell software engineer works together to obtain newer releases. Is there a reason why a standard R720 would be preferable over an OEM XL system?Generally, that will depend on individuals. Standard servers will have standard support. OEM XL will need specific support. Support in a sense of firmware updates and hardware compatibility.Here's a simple article back in 2011 on OEM branding: https://dell.to/3BYL77F Let me know if that clears the air for you.DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"HelloThis note should be in the installation instructions of power supply firmware:IMPORTANT:After a successful power supply firmware download, the managed system turns off for a duration ranging from three to twenty minutes to continue updating the firmware. It is imperative not to interrupt/restart manually during this time. Update time can vary but should be approximately 10 minutes. Margin should be added to assure the Dell Update Package (DUP) is not interrupted (some DUPs may take up to 20 minutes). Once the firmware update is complete, the managed system reboots automatically.If you interrupt the update process then the firmware may be corrupted. You can attempt to update the firmware again. If the firmware will not update with both PSUs installed then you can try with just the PSU installed that needs the update. If the system will not power on or allow the update with both or just the one PSU installed then you will likely need to replace the PSU.Long restarts are normal during BIOS and firmware updates. You should avoid interrupting the update process.

AMD CPUs have more PCIe lanes so they can support more NVMe drives and I/O in general on just one CPU.The R6515 and the R7515 are the ones we looked at. The R6515 would be the equivalent of the R640 and the R7515 the equivalent of R740xd.We went with R6515 model (1U) in the end as it had two extra PCIe slots as well as up to 10 NVMe/SAS/SATA drives using just the single CPU.

They can also be caused by memory, system board, or the CPU/memory controller.The operating system is stating that this is a hardware issue because the processor halted the system when it encountered the non-maskable interrupt. The CPU was not able to recover from the error so it halted the system creating a blue screen. The dump files just point to the cause of the halt which is the processor.I would suggest checking the hardware log within the BMC for any memory errors that occurred at the time of the blue screen. If the same memory is producing errors when the blue screens occur then swap the memory around to see if the errors follow the memory, stay with the slot, or stay with the CPU/memory controller. If you installed a driver for virtual or physical hardware around the time this issue started then that driver is likely the cause.

The manual shows 6 SATA connectors, but when I tried to configure the server for purchase, it was persistent about wanting me to chose a PERC controller card. If there is a motherboard controller, will it be adequate? Yes, it does. Be sure to check the Onboard SATA option under Hard Drive Configuration. If you enable RAID, you will get the S100 controller ... leave RAID disabled and use Windows software RAID instead.Again, when trying to configure with UEFI boot, it indicated configuration conflicts. I'm ordering it without HDDs, but want to use an existing 4TB drive. I'll need to configure GBT and will need UEFI for that, I believe. Is this a problem?You can't order a server without a drive (see below **). If you plan to use your own, order it with the smallest/cheapest drive available, then swap it out later.

"T610 works well with add on video so no need to worry.Power off the machine, insert your new PCIe video card.Reconnect power and boot your machine into BIOS and DISABLE on board video, save and exit BIOS. On reboot, at the splash screen, shut down the machine by holding the power button. Connect you monitor to the new video card and again boot the machine.All should work fine. As AXI said, you can always restore BIOS to default by setting the NVRAM_CLR jumper on the motherboard.Do note that by adding a video card, you will loose some of the iDRAC features like being able to remotely view the last boot screen (as the video is no longer via the iDRAC card). If this is important to you, then you need to reassess.If you try this on a server without a BIOS option to DISABLE on board video, then you are likely to have problems wiyth add on video cards.

"HelloThe T320 has two groups of memory, slots 1,2,3 and slots 4,5,6, spread across three channels. The T320 supports flexible memory configurations, so optimal memory configurations are not strictly enforced. There are many potential ways that you can populate the memory. Your proposed population might work. Following memory population rules and guidelines the best configuration would be:16GB in 1,2,38GB in 4,5Best practice is to not mix memory within a memory grouping.

You should not mix memory within a bank. In previous generation servers we did not allow the type of population you are planning, but 12th generation and later servers support flexible memory configurations. That means that we have very few population restrictions. You can put the memory almost anywhere you want. That does not mean that any population will work or be supported. It just means that we do not block non-optimal memory configurations as much as we did in the past.

"@DELL-Joey C, @DELL-Marco B, hiProblem identified and solved. However, for the life of me i cannot understand why.Both the 4P 10G x710 cards (68M95) were new. They were installed at the same time in both R630 units. Both Lifecycle controllers we then run independently for updates and both gave the same SUP0528 critical error. Installing the same rNDC NIC into a third R530 to serve as a testbed gave the same results. Initial suspicions were conflicts with other hardware but this did not turn out to be the case in subsequent tests. Attention was turned back to the rNDC card.Up until now, neither of the two rNDC NICs were used operationally. They were connected to the mainboard and powered up but no actual data was passed through the ports. Having then connected one of the four SFP ports to our switches and enabled it, inexplicably, the Lifecycle controller now does not flag the critical error. Turning to the second server and enabling a port on the second rNDC NIC and the precisely the same behaviour occurred.It seems that once the lifecycle controller downloaded the online catalog and proceeded to interrogate the hardware, it may have been reading a value from the x710 daughtercards that it did not expect - perhaps a register or a count (for data throughput, say). Whatever it is was cleared the moment traffic was flowing through the cards. Cold booting both units and the Lifecycle controller is able to now continue through to the firmware listing table.A very odd behaviour and one that was quite unexpected. It may be helpful to Teir 2 support or if this is passed on to the engineers. I am unsure how common this is with other x710 variants but there is evidently something with the Lifecycle firmware that it did not like until the rNDC cards were 'used'.CheersPopsView solution in original post",doc_1583,1583

"Klb_Arc,It will be based on whether the existing 4GB dimms are Udimms or Rdimms. If the 4GB dimms are UDimms then the only option you would have would be adding more of the 4GB dimms to reach 48GB. Now if they are Rdimms you more options. With Rdimms you can go to 96GB with 12 8GB dimms, or even 192GB, if you were to chose 12 16GB dimms. With mixing them I would suggest adding 4 8GB dimms and placing them in A1, A2, B1, and B2. Then place the 4 4GB dimms in slots A4, A5, B4, and B5. That would leave you with a total of 48GB total.

The rebuild should start automatically if you have a hot spare.If you want to retain your slot assignments then you could unassign the hot spare, remove the hot spare, offline the predictive failure drive, physically remove the pred fail drive, and then insert the hot spare into that slot. A rebuild should initiate automatically, assign it as a hot spare if it doesn't. This would allow you to keep the drive/slot assignments the same as they currently are.

"The issue was resolved this morning, and the server is running normally. I'll post the solution to help others in the future.I cut power to the rack overnight. This morning I removed all the power cables from the server and the UPSs. I swapped PSUs 3 and 4, and re-seated PSUs 1 and 2. I again drained power from the board by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. I then plugged everything back in, and checked all the cables. I restored power to the rack and powered on the server and it came on as normal.So I guess it was nothing special, just swapping PSU positions, re-seating them, checking and re-seating cables, and draining the board.

"Take a look at the manual for the R410 regarding memory population:support.dell.com/.../HOM.pdfAnd take a look at the UPDATED memory information from Dell regarding 16GB DIMM's:support.dell.com/.../TSen.pdfAlso remember that Dell does not set the rules - the memory controller's specifications come from INTEL and Dell's BIOS may vary slightly from that.We are used to thinking of populating memory in pairs for greatest performance with as popular and common as dual-channel memory is, but some systems, including the R410, support three channels, meaning that configurations with 3 DIMM's (or multiples thereof) are the IDEAL configurations, as it allows the system to take advantage of 3-channel performance.  Non-ideal - or unbalanced - configurations result from not populating the memory the way the controller works best.Remember also that ALL processors must have the EXACT same memory configuration.  So, if you put one DIMM in slot 1 of processor 1, then processor 2 must have a single (and matching) DIMM in its slot 1.  Like wise, if you have an 8GB DIMM in slot 1 and a 4GB DIMM in slot 2, this is considered ""unbalanced"" and will give you a warning in BIOS, but will work,  however, processor 2 must also have 8GB in slot 1 and 4GB in slot 2.If you want to use 16GB DIMM's, to eventually upgrade to the max, that is fine, but you MUST use RDIMM's (UDIMM's larger than 2GB are not supported), for starters.  According to the docs, you put as many 16GB DIMM's in as you can afford right now, but with 2 processors, you can only do the following:1x16GB per processor (2 total) for 32GB of RAM - populate in slot 1, which is channel 02x16GB per processor (4 total) for 64GB of RAM - populate in slots 1 and 2, which populates channels 0 and 13x16GB per processor (6 total) for 96GB of RAM - populate in slots 1, 2, and 3, which populates channels 0, 1, and 24x16GB per processor (8 total) for 128GB of RAM - populate in slots 1, 2, 3, and 4, adds a second DIMM to channel 0Slots are labeled, starting nearest the processor, as 4 | 1 | 2 | 3.The 3-DIMM/processor configurations are ideal, because it take advantage of all channels AND keeps memory running at 1333MHz ... if you use the 4-DIMM/processor configurations, yes,  you will have more memory available, but it will clock down to 1067MHz.  You may or may not see much affect/difference from the memory speed, but you may in some applications.View solution in original post",doc_1643,1643

"The T610 only has PCIe 4x slots (not open-ended from what I've seen, so you cannot put in a 'larger' PCIe card either).This means that physically you can put in a 1x or 4x PCIe card. However, Dell's server bios isn't really built around the idea that you'd add a videocard (that's more for a desktop computer). You may be able to get it to work, but don't count on support or assistance from Dell.A few notes: - there is most likely no power cable for a videocard in the server, so your videocard would need to be a model that doesn't require extra power.- if you have a DRAC, depending on the model DRAC, you'll loose (part of) it's functionality- you may or may not be able to disable the onboard videocard. This could cause a conflict or prevent the add-on card from working.If you're looking for a Dell tower system with dual processor support, I'd suggest to get a Precision Workstation T5500 or T7500. These are built to hold videocards and can handle dual processor and lots of memory. They are also available with a PERC6i (or at least the T7500 is) for full raid support.

You can use the Windows Recovery Environment to try to get the OS running again. You may be able to get enough functionality to backup some data, but it is unlikely the OS will ever be stable again. The data could also be corrupted.The amount of corruption that occurred will depend on how much you tried to do on the other controller. When that other controller wrote data to the drive it replaced sections of data that were previously on the drive. The other controller may have initialized the entire drive or you may have missing data segments in various places throughout the drive.If this data is critical and you don't have a backup then you should contact a data recovery company.

Since Dell supports numerous Linux distros, it would be useful to get some Linux-specific hardware support.For Linux users: None of the toolkit software is needed for the iDRAC firmware update.SOLUTION:1. On any Linux client machine, browse to the associated dell.com/support for the service tag/server model.2.

I had numerous failures uploading and installing the firmware image using the iDRAC6 web GUI, so I recommend rebooting both the client machine with fresh browser session,  and the iDRAC. To avoid a factory reset of the iDRAC and lose settigs, a soft-reset can be easily via secure shelle:Client machine's command line:ssh yourLoginName@yourIDRACipAddresspassword:/admin1-> racadm racreset6. Give the iDRAC a 5 minutes  to reboot. On your Linux client machine use a browser to log into the iDRAC through the web gui.7. Browse to iDRAC Settings > Update > click Browse > select ~/Downloads/idrac_firmware_2.90/payload/firmimg.d6 (or wherever the firmware image was extracted).8. ""Upload (Step 1 of 3) > Click upload.

"HelloThe BMC controls fan speeds. If the BMC is not initializing then they will run at 100%. You will likely experience performance issues as well because throttling of the CPU and memory will also occur if the BMC is not functioning correctly.You can sometimes reflash the system BIOS and BMC, but the BMC has to be partially functional to be able to complete a firmware update. If the BMC is not initializing enough to be able to update firmware then you can try draining flea power from the system and completing no POST troubleshooting. Any hardware attached to the system can disrupt initialization of any other hardware, so no POST troubleshooting involves removing unnecessary hardware. If you recently made a change when this issue started then I would start with undoing that change.If updating, draining flea power, and removing unnecessary hardware has no effect then you will likely need to replace the system board to correct the issue.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_1727,1727

"Javik,To give you an idea of how sparce you can take the server, this is the Minimum hardware required to POST.System boardProcessor (with heatsink) in socket 1One stick of memory in slot 11 power supplyControl panel (to turn on system)SideplaneBoth PCI risers in matching configuration Beyond that would be the raid controller and drives.Placing the heatsink on the processor slot without the processor can cause issues if there is any contact with the contact surface of the slot, so if you attempt that you may make sure that there is no contact BEFORE powering. I am not seeing a blank/filler available for that CPU2 slot either. There isn't a power on timer feature for the server per se. The server does offer the ability to Wake on LAN, as well as having BIOS power settings that will allow it to power on when power is detected. So if you can find a UPS/PDU with a power on/off timer, then you could set it up that way. I hope this helps clarify your questions. DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?

"HelloIs there some firmware update for the controller to enable it to display the full 3tb?No, the SAS6iR does not support drive sizes larger than 2TB.Hard Drive Controllers –    IMPORTANT NOTE! Only the Dell H700 and H800 currently support the 3TB drives (H200 will add support later this year) - NO earlier controllers, such as the PERC4/5/6, SAS5/6 (or ANY other Dell controller not mentioned) have this support and in some cases, even though you may be able to see the drive, this has NOT been tested or validated, so possible data loss could be experienced.

For non-Dell controllers, contact the controller vendor for their support statement on >2TB drives.Only PERC7 and later controllers support drive sizes larger than 2TB.

"Hello VolkerThe iDRAC may have switched to shared mode. Connect network cables to the integrated NIC to see if you can connect to it from there.If that does not allow a connection then I would put the external video back in and boot to the OS. Use RACADM commands or OpenManage Server Administrator to find out what the current iDRAC settings are, and to find out if it is coming online. If the iDRAC is not coming online then you should receive an initialization failure during boot.It sounds like the integrated video controller has failed. The iDRAC console will not work without the integrated video. The iDRAC connection issues are likely just a setting/configuration issue that occurred while troubleshooting the video issue.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise EngineerView solution in original post",doc_1750,1750

We only sell 1GB SD cards with it(on the R815). The 2GB SD card is listed as a valid replacement for the 1GB cards in my parts database for the R815.There is not a lot of specs available on the IDSDM. It appears to be an extremely basic pass-through/converter that takes SD cards and presents them as USB 2.0 devices to the system board. According to documentation the IDSDMs in 11th and 12th generation servers are identical in functionality. I have 2GB SD modules in my R720. Based on all of this information 1 and 2GB modules should work without issue. Nothing states that larger sizes will not work, but we don't sell them in that configuration. The 8GB module is intended for Vflash. Here are the part numbers I have listed on the R815. You will need to call spare parts to order these:0XW5C - 8GB Intended for Vflash(Vlash can use any size card up to 8GB) 738M1 - 2GB Intended for Vflash, but listed as a valid replacement for 1GB Modules P789K - 1GB Intended for SD Module RX790 - 1GB Intended for SD ModuleThe 8GB modules will likely work, but I would recommend testing before buying them for all of your servers.

"Whoollybully,I've been struggling with the same issue.From searching older threads on this forum, i reached the conclusion that Dell no longer has a non iDRAC (express or integrated) way to run the 'lifecycle controller repair package"", i.e. there is no way to burn an ISO file/image and run something off the DVD or USB drive at startup.The solution for me was to redo the firmware update using the Dell Repository Manager - just for the R510. During the deploy step, when creating the iso package, click the box that says (overwrite) even if firmware levels are the same. I flashed this ISO to a USB using Rufus and redid my update and requested reboot, and magically the F10 System Services option returned to the POST page and i could get to the System Services DELL GUI.Note that the R510 package i used the first time i just downloaded from the dell site and perhaps the download manager version is different.Next problem. I cannot start or see the Lifecycle Controller GUI, but assume it's because i still don't have and IDRAC (express or enterprise) installed yet which i ordered. Nor can i install the OS using the System Services GUI because it say it can't find the 'catalog file' .

I asked you for a direct visual confirmation of the card because I wanted to verify if it was the Dell Express Flash NVMe or the Intel Branded PCIe storage devices .In the pictures it can be clearly seen it is the Intel Branded PCIe storage devices  what we are talking about.

"Tiagoheineck,To clarify, you are seeing the server say that ECC is now disabled? Seeing that is likely due to the Memory Mode being set to ECC, but with a dimm present in A1 it will disable that memory mode.  To populate the server in Adv ECC mode would need the dimms to be in slot A2, A3, and B2, and B3.If you set the servers Memory Mode to Optimizer then the dimms indeed would go to A1, A2, and B2, B3.To verify the mode the server is set to just access the BIOS (F2 on startup) and then under Memory Settings, verify what Memory Operating Mode is listed as.Lastly, although the R710 does support 16gb dimms, there are some processors that may not be compatible with using the 16gb dimms.

"Additional memory information:The DDR3 memory interface consists of three channels, with up to two RDIMMs or UDIMMs per channel for single/dual rank and up to two RDIMMs per channel for quad rank. The interface uses 2 GB, 4 GB, 8GB or 16 GB RDIMMs; only 1 GB or 2 GB UDIMMs are supported. The memory mode is dependent on how the memory is populated in the system:Three channels per CPU populated identically Typically, the system will be set to run in Memory Optimized (Independent Channel) mode in this configuration. This mode offers the most DIMM population flexibility and system memory capacity, but offers the least number of RAS (reliability, availability, service) features. -All three channels must be populated identically. -The first two channels per CPU populated identically with the third channel unused  Typically, two channels operate in Advanced ECC (Lockstep) mode with each other by having the cache line split across both channels. This mode provides improved RAS features (SDDC support for x8-based memory). -For Memory Mirroring, two channels operate as mirrors of each other-writes go to both channels and reads alternate between the two channels.-One channel per CPU populated This is a simple Memory Optimized mode. No mirroring or sparing is supported.The R610 memory interface supports memory demand and patrol scrubbing, single-bit correction and multi-bit error detection. Correction of a x4 or x8 device failure is also possible with SDDC in the Advanced ECC mode. Additionally, correction of a x4 device failure is possible in the Memory Optimized mode.-If DIMMs of different speeds are mixed, all channels will operate at the fastest common frequency. -RDIMMs and UDIMMs cannot be mixed. -If memory mirroring is enabled, identical DIMMs must be installed in the same slots across both channels. The third channel of each processor is unavailable for memory mirroring.-The first DIMM slot in each channel is color-coded with white ejection tabs for ease of installation. -The DIMM sockets are placed 450 mils (11.43 mm) apart, center-to-center in order to provide enough space for sufficient airflow to cool stacked DIMMs. -The R610 supports up to 12 DIMMs. DIMMs must be installed in each channel starting with the DIMM slot farthest from the processor. Population order will be identified by the silkscreen designator and the System Information Label (SIL) located on the chassis cover. o Memory Optimized: {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} o Advanced ECC or Mirrored: {2, 3}, {5, 6} o Quad Rank or UDIMM: {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}In the scenario's you have presented, each one will work in Optimized mode.  However, adding 1300mhz memory with a 1060 will result in all the memory running at 1060, the fastest common denominator.    Regards,Geoff PDell | Social Outreach Services - EnterpriseGet Support on Twitter @DellCaresProDownload the Dell Quick Resource Locator app today to access PowerEdge support content on your mobile device!(iOS, Android, Windows)View solution in original post",doc_1820,1820

"Hi 2ndSource. The latest iDRAC firmware for R620 is 2.65.65.65. As it seems you have a very old firmware, so I recommend performing staged updates (like 1.66.65 -> 2.10.10.10 -> 2.30.30.30 -> 2.65.65.65). Regarding the Lifecycle Controller, you first should update it to the latest version when it was separated from iDRAC.Here's the link: https://dell.to/2FClOjM OR You decide for the platform-specific bootable ISO: https://dell.to/3iAn4CL with this ISO you update all components at once.

"the dset report displays normal temperatures since it measures the inlet temperature (26-28 deg C) and the cpu temperature (57-62 degC).The server is working as intended. There is nothing to fix. This has been reported before and we have investigated it. Our 12th generation servers had a massive overhaul with thermal and acoustic design. Because of this the chassis can get hot to the touch at the rear of the system, but it poses no risk to system components.You can change the default fan control to increase air flow and reduce the exhaust temperature, but this will increase noise and electricity usage.

"Out of the group you listed, the only one that looks like it could be compatible would be the Hynix. Plus when looking at dimms for the R510, there is a shared dimm, but it is a 2GB. I don't see any other cross compatible ones listed. So it may be up to trial and error on the ones you have. Also you can mix memory brands, as dimm populations can be different as long as the population rules for each socket and mode are followed.If dimms of different speeds are mixed, all channels across all CPUs operate at the slowest dimm's common frequency.Only one type of dimm is allowed per system: UDIMM or RDIMM. They cannot be mixed.The first dimm slot in each channel is color-coded with white ejection tabs for ease of identification.Rank Sparing and MirroringDimms must be installed in each channel starting with the Dimm farthest from the processor. Dimms should be installed with the largest rank count to the smallest. For example, if DR are mixed with SR Dimms, the DRs should be placed in the lowest Dimm slots then the SR Dimms.Here are a couple part numbers if needed.D65JJ - 4GB 1600MHz 2RX8CPX35 - 8GB 1600MHz 2RX4 Low VoltageDELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#IWork4DellDid I answer your query?
